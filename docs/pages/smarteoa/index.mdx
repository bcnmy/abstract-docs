# Smart EOAs

Previously, the only way to leverage smart account capabilities (batching, multichain orchestration, gasless experiences, 
sessions, ...) was to desposit funds from an EOA to a smart account (SCA).

This created a friction point for users and fragmented their liquidity into multiple addresses. For this reason, the growth
of the Smart Account solutions has never reached the levels of EOA accounts.

## Combining the Best of Both Worlds

The Biconomy Smart EOA solution enables developers to build apps which offer the best of EOA wallets and the best of 
Smart Account wallets. 

### 1. Smart Account benefits:
- Multichain Orchestration support (single signature, multiple transactions across multiple chains)
- Transaction batching support
- Sponosring gas for user transactions
- Paying for gas with ERC-20 tokens (even across chains)

### 2. EOA benefits
- Preserving user transaction history
- User assets all on one address (no fragmentation)
- Account portability (users can export their account to different wallets)

With Biconomy Smart EOAs - you *don't* have to choose.

### There are two core ways to use Smart EOAs:

1. **Companion Accounts** <br/>
Works with external wallets (MetaMask, Trust, Rabby, ...) and doesn't require EIP-7702 (but is fully compatible with EIP-7702) <br/> <br/>
2. **Direct Delegation** <br/> 
Works with embedded wallets (Privy, Dynamic, Web3Auth, Magic, ...). Requires both the wallet and the chain to support EIP-7702.

## Companion Accounts

The Biconomy approach to Smart EOAs for External Wallets (MetaMask, Rabby, Trust, ...) uses the *Companion Account* model! The Companion Account
is a passthrough smart account deployed and owned by the application through which all user
transactions are processed. The core difference of the Companion Account flow from traditional 
account flows is that Companion Accounts *never* hold funds.

The standard Companion Account flow is:

1) Deposit required tokens into the Companion Account
2) Process all the necessary transactions
3) Return all resulting tokens/positions/assets back into the EOA

:::info[Single Signature Experience]
This entire flow is executed with a *single* user signature. The user *never* explicitly deposits
to the Companion account. In fact, the user doesn't even need to be aware of the existance of the
companion account.
:::

:::tip[Example]
The user wishes to swap WETH to USDC, bridge the USDC to Arbitrum and supply it to AAVE on 
Arbitrum.

1. WETH is deposited to the Companion Account
2. The swap instruction is executed on the Companion Account
3. The bridge function call is made on the Companion Account
4. The `supply` function call is made to AAVE on Arbitrum on the Companion Account
5. aUSDC tokens are transferred to the EOA
<br/>
All of this is a *single signature* for the user, directly from their EOA - without ever
explicitly depositing to the Companion Account.

## Direct Delegation

Certain types of wallets allow users to delegate directly to a Biconomy Nexus account. When working with those wallets, developers
don't need to use Companion Accounts. For now, this mostly applies to embedded wallets such as Privy, Dynamic, etc...
