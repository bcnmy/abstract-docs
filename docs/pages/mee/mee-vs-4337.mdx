# Beyond Account Abstraction: ERC-4337 vs. MEE

## The Evolution of Blockchain Infrastructure

ERC-4337 introduced account abstraction, significantly improving blockchain UX. However, as applications grow in complexity and users operate across multiple chains, developers have encountered limitations that Modular Execution Environments (MEE) are designed to solve.

### Full ERC-4337 Parity
The Modular Execution Environment (MEE) stack has *all* the features that ERC-4337 has _and_ it retains the 
same industry-leading security profile while offering significantly more features, less latency and 
easier integration.

MEE is compliant with the following standards:

- **ERC-4337 UserOps** <br/>
MEE Uses the same data model as ERC-4337 <br/> <br/>
- **EIP-7702** <br/>
MEE can easily be set as the execution environment for an EIP-7702 enabled EOA <br/> <br/>
- **ERC-7579** <br/>
MEE uses smart account validators which are compliant with the most widely used smart account standard. <br/> <br/>
- **ERC-7710 / ERC-7715** <br/>
MEE can request execution through an ERC-7715 delegation and claim it on an ERC-7710 compliant contract. <br/> <br/>


## Key Advantages of MEE Over ERC-4337

### 1. True Composability

**ERC-4337:** Limited to static batching where all calldata must be known upfront. Transactions within a batch cannot use the results of previous steps.

**MEE:** Enables dynamic execution where each step can reference outputs from previous steps. This allows for conditional execution, runtime calculations, and complex transaction flows even on a single chain.

### 2. Cross-Chain Orchestration

**ERC-4337:** Limited to single-chain operations. Cross-chain activities require multiple separate transactions with separate signatures.

**MEE:** Natively orchestrates operations across chains, handling dependencies and timing considerations automatically. A single signature can authorize a complex flow spanning multiple chains.

### 3. Universal Gas Abstraction

**ERC-4337:** Supports paying gas in tokens on a single chain, but each chain's operations require separate gas management.

**MEE:** Allows paying for gas on any chain using tokens from any other supported chain. A single gas tank can fund operations across all chains.

### 4. Transaction Scheduling and Automation

**ERC-4337:** No native support for scheduling or recurring transactions.

**MEE:** Supports scheduling transactions for future execution and setting up recurring execution patterns, enabling automation of complex workflows.

## Capability Comparison

| Capability | ERC-4337 | MEE |
|------------|----------|-----|
| **Transaction Execution** | | |
| Simple batch transactions | ✅ | ✅ |
| Dynamic composable transactions | ❌ | ✅ |
| Output-to-input references | ❌ | ✅ |
| Transaction scheduling | ❌ | ✅ |
| Recurring transactions | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Gas Management** | | |
| Pay gas in tokens (single chain) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Pay gas in tokens (cross-chain) | ❌ | ✅ |
| Unified gas sponsorship | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Wallet Support** | | |
| Smart contract wallets | ✅ | ✅ |
| EOA wallets | ❌** | ✅ |
| **Multi-Chain Support** | | |
| Single-chain operations | ✅ | ✅ |
| Cross-chain orchestration | ❌ | ✅ |
| Bridge completion detection | ❌ | ✅ |
| Chain-agnostic development | ❌ | ✅ |

**   ERC-4337 supports EOA wallets exclusively when paired with EIP-7702. MEE supports EOA wallets by default.

## Beyond the Technical: Use Cases Enabled by MEE

MEE enables new user experiences that would be impractical with ERC-4337:

1. **Cross-Chain DeFi Strategies**  
   Bridge assets to highest-yielding chains, swap to required assets, and deposit into protocols with a single signature.

2. **Conditional Asset Management**  
   Create execution flows based on price conditions, bridge completions, or yield opportunities across multiple chains.

3. **Autonomous Agent Workflows**  
   Authorize agents to execute strategies within user-defined boundaries without requiring multiple signatures.

## Conclusion

ERC-4337 was a critical stepping stone for blockchain UX. MEE builds directly on this foundation, preserving all benefits while solving fundamental limitations in composability and cross-chain orchestration.

MEE isn't replacing ERC-4337—it's fulfilling its vision of making blockchain interactions seamless across the increasingly fragmented chain landscape, benefiting both developers and users with simpler, more powerful transaction capabilities - while reatining
all of the features of the ERC-4337 stack.
