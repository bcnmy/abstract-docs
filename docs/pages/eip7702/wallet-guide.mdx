# EIP7702 Guide

## Intro - Why EIP7702
EIP7702 is an upcoming upgrade to EVM chains which will enable wallets to convert their user EOAs to Smart Accounts. By 
upgrading the users to Smart Accounts, users will gain many meaningful UX upgrades:

- Ability to sponsor user gas
- Ability for users to pay for gas in ERC20 tokens
- Ability to batch execute transactions

### Biconomy Unique Advantages 

Biconomy has built a comprehensive suite for wallets to upgrade their users to Smart Accounts, built on top of our 
Modular Execution Environment and Bundler/Paymaster infrastructure. Biconomy is unique among EIP7702 infrastructure 
providers by offering:

- Ability to pay for gas across multiple chain (e.g. user has USDC on Optimism, uses that to pay for transaction execution on Base)
- Ability to batch execute multiple transactions across multiple chains with a single user signature
- Ability to use intent-based execution for extremely fast liquidity fronting

## Quickstart Guide for Developers

::::steps
#### Install Packages
Install AbstractJS TypeScript SDK and viem 

```bash
npm install @biconomy/abstractjs viem
```

#### Sign a wallet authorization
In order add Smart Account capabilities to an EOA account, you must sign an authorization specifying which
Smart Account address will be "installed" on the EOA address. In order to save on gas costs, you will be setting
the authorization to a singleton contract - which means that no new contracts will need to be deployed.  


```ts
// This is the address of the EOA to which 
// address we'll be "installing" the smart account to.
const eoa = privateKeyToAccount('0xPrivateKey')

// Create an instance of a viem wallet client and extend it with the 
// required eip7702 actions.
const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  chain: odysseyTestnet,
  account: eoa,
  transport: http(),
}).extend(eip7702Actions())

const authorization = await walletClient.signAuthorization({
  // Address of the Nexus Proxy Singleton
  contractAddress: nexusProxyAddress 
})
```

#### Initialize the Modular Execution Environment

```ts
const meeClient = createMeeClient({
  nodeUrl: 'https://mee-node.biconomy.io'
})
```

#### Set up the Smart Account
Initialize the Smart Account you will be using for delegation. In this case, we'll
be using Biconomy Nexus.

```ts
const account = await toMultichainNexusAccount({
  chains: [odysseyTestnet],
  signer: eoa,
  // Override the address of the account to the EOA address
  address: eoa.address
})
```

#### Execute a Supertransaction

```ts
const quote = await getQuote(meeClient, {
  instructions: [
    {
      calls: [
        { to: zeroAddress, gasLimit: 100_000n, value: 0n }
      ],
      chainId: optimism.id
    }
  ],
  feeToken: mcUSDC.on(optimism.id)
})

const hash = await executeQuote(meeSerivice, quote)
```
