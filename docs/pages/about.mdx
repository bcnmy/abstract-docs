# Why Choose Biconomy?

Biconomy is the industry leader in providing tooling which simplifies developer and user experiences 
onchain. Since our founding in 2019, we have served millions of users with our rigorously
audited contracts and efficient and scalable infrastructure. Due to our commitments to reliability, 
Biconomy has been the choice for leading blockchain companies and protocols.

Through years of R&D and conversations with our customers, Biconomy has developed a comprehensive suite
of contracts, infrastructure and tooling enabling radical improvements in user experience, cross-chain and
multichain transaction execution and secure multichain automation for bots and AI agents.

The modern onchain development environment is increasingly multichain, requries the use of bridges
and intent solvers or cross-chain messaging providers. User balances are scattered across multiple
chains, while apps are increasingly being deployed on general-purpose and app specific rollups.

In such an environment, you need tooling which helps you spend time shipping features, instead of
wrestling with infrastructure. For a fast and secure path to production - choose the Biconomy stack.

## AbstractJS - An SDK for Modern Onchain Apps

Our flagship SDK - AbstractJS - has been built from the ground up to support developers building in
a multichain environment. Orchestrate complex transaction flows which span multiple chains, trigger both
bundlers and solvers or leverage cross-chain messaging in just a few lines of code. 

✔ Build complex user transaction flows in record time 

✔ Effortlessly orchestrate complex multi-chain and chain abstracted flows


## Build chain abstracted apps

The Biconomy stack offers developers the ability to treat multiple blockchains as if
they're a single execution environment. In a single signature, users can execute transactions
on multiple chains, move funds from user balances across all chains to where they are needed and
batch execute transactions.

✔ Subsecond cross-chain execution powered by intents and resource locks

✔ Mix-and-match intents and transactions in the same operation

✔ Pull user funds from multiple chains and multiple tokens in a single transaction

✔ Execute multiple transactions across multiple chains with a single signature

## Cross-chain gas abstraction

Sponsor transactions across multiple chains with a single gas tank (coming soon) or pay for gas
with native coins or ERC20 tokens across multiple chains (available now) with our multichain native
infrastructure.

✔ Sponsor gas across multiple chains with a single gas tank

✔ Pay for gas in ERC20 tokens, even across chains (e.g. pay for gas on Base with USDC on Optimism)

✔ Pay for gas in native tokens on remote chains (e.g. pay for gas on Polygon with ETH on Arbitrum)



## Cross-chain Composability

Make sure all of your cross-chain flows execute flawlessly by dynamically injecting the exact amount received
from bridges or solvers into your function parameters. Make failing transactions due to slippage issues a thing of the 
past. 

Build flows which use the output of one function call as the input of another - without writing smart contracts.

✔ Compose contract calls without writing smart contracts

✔ Dynamically inject the exact amount received from bridges into function calls on the target chain 


## Hybrid Execution - Transactions and Intents

Onchain execution is becoming heterogenous - with solvers moving funds and accessing liquidity
across multiple chains in seconds. Transactions, on the other side offer much more flexibility in
interacting with blockchains. Our stack elegantly combines both transactions and intents into a single
data object - allowing you to build without compromises.

## Best-in-class EOA Support

Onboarding to smart accounts can be a pain. This is why we have developed the Fusion Module.
By encoding additional instructions into an EVM transaction, developers are able to encode
single-signature multi-chain batch execution of transactions - while giving users the benefit
of using their regular EOA accounts.

✔ Batch execute transactions (e.g. approve + swap) with regular EOA accounts with a single signature

✔ Execute complex multi-chain flows with a single signature from regular EOA accounts

✔ Support for gasless batch execution for EOA accounts when working with ERC20Permit compliant tokens

## Industry-leading Modules Support

From Smart Sessions, Passkeys - to TimeLocks, Multisigs and Resource Locks - Biconomy accounts
and SDKs are built to enable developers to effortlessly add new functionality to user accounts.

✔ Build automation bots and AI Agents with secure guardrails using Smart Sessions

✔ Enable users to sign transactions with biometrics (fingerprint, FaceID)

✔ Add resource locks to accounts


## No Vendor Lock-In

All of our infrastructure and tooling supports all major Smart Account providers and all of our 
accounts support all major infrastructure providers. Either choose Biconomy as a full service 
key-in-hand solution or mix-and-match Biconomy accounts, SDK and infrastructure with alternative
Smart Account providers.

✔ Use any account and infrastructure provider you choose
