# Build a Chain Abstracted App

For this tutorial, we will be building a chain abstracted app, powered by the Biconomy Modular Execution Environment!

## Goals

We want to build an app with the following features:

::::steps
#### Unified Balance
User sees a unified balance across all chains

#### Cross-Chain Transactions with Intents
User can deposit to _any_ AAVE market in a single signature. Intents are used to move the liquidity
around

#### Pay for Gas With ERC20 Tokens on Any Chain
The user will be able to pay for the execution of all transactions on all chains with on any 
chain where they have either native or ERC20 tokens 

#### Withdraw from Multiple AAVE Positions with a Single Signature
The user can withdraw all of their AAVE positions across all chains with a single 
signature. 
::::

The entire interface should be extremely straightforward for the user, with no chain switching, bridging or managing gas.

## Core concepts

The app which we build in this guide will leverage all the latest features available in `AbstractJS` SDK and 
the Biconomy stack! Some highlights:

- Using a Unified Multichain Balance
- Triggering [Intents](/mee/tutorials/execute-intent) and Transactions in as single operation
- Executing multiple transactions on multiple chains with a single signature
- Using automatic orchestration provided by the Biconomy MEE Node


## Step-by-Step Tutorial
:::tip
This tutorial will use the most verbose coding style, in order to explain all of the concepts. `AbstractJS` comes with 
many utilities which would enable this app to be written in less lines of code.
:::
## Building the app

::::steps
#### Creating a New Project

For this tutorial we'll be using `bun` to create a new project. 

If you don't have `bun`, you can install it by running:
```bash [Install Bun]
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

Then create a new project called `chapp-example`
```bash [Create a new project]
mkdir chapp-example & cd ./chapp-example & bun init
```

#### Install Required Dependencies: AbstractJS and Viem

```bash [Install AbstractJS and Viem]
bun add @biconomy/abstractjs viem @rhinestone/module-sdk@0.2.3
```

#### Create a TypeScript File

```bash [Create app.ts]
touch app.ts
```

#### Connect to the Smart Account

Our chain abstracted app will be powered by the Biconomy Nexus smart account. Since we're working
in a multichain environment, `AbstractJS` comes with a helpful utility function to manage instances of 
smart accounts across multiple chains. 

In this example, we'll create a smart account which has an EOA wallet
as the owner. In order to easily create an EOA for testing purposes,
we'll create the EOA through a `viem` utility, by providing a private 
key.

```ts [Create EOA signer]
const eoa = privateKeyToAccount('0x... Private Key Goes Here')
```

Then, let's connect to our Smart Account with the utility function:

```ts [Initialize Multichain Smart Account]
const mcNexus = await toMultichainNexusAccount({
  chains: [optimism, base, polygon, arbitrum],
  signer: eoa
})
```

:::tip[Automated Account Managemnet]
You don't have to worry about deploying the user smart accounts. If the 
smart account is not deployed on chain where you need it, `AbstractJS`
will automatically encode an instruction which deploys the account and 
executes the desired transaction together.
:::

#### Initialize the `meeClient`

In order to execute transactions through the Biconomy [MEE Node](/explained/mee), we need to establish a connection 
to it. `AbstractJS` makes this easy with a helper function:

```ts [Connect to MEE Node]
const meeClient = createMeeClient({
  account: mcNexus
})
```

:::tip[Connecting to nodes]
You can pass an optional `url` paramter in the `createMeeClient` if 
you want to connect to a custom MEE Node. The SDK defaults to 
`https://mee-node.biconomy.io`, which is a node hosted by Biconomy.
:::

#### Fund the Smart Account Address

Fetch the Smart Account address on the chain where you want to 
fund your wallet. For example, let's fetch the address for `Optimism`

```ts
console.log(
  mcNexus.deploymentOn(optimism.id).address
)
```

:::tip[Address Derivations]
AbstractJS uses the `CREATE2` smart account generation in the background
so the addresses on most chains should be identical. However,
some chains - like `zkSync` - derive their addresses diferently. We 
recommend always using the `deploymentOn` function to fetch the 
address.
:::

Then send USDC to the Smart Account address! 

:::tip[Using other tokens]
For the purposes of this tutorial, we'll be working with `USDC`. However, you can work with a different token.
To check which tokens are supported for gas payments, check out the [MEE Node Dashboard](https://mee-node.biconomy.io/dashboard)
:::

#### Load the Required Smart Contracts

For this app, we'll need access to three contracts. 

- USDC Token Contract
- aUSDC Token Contract
- AAVE V3 Pool Contract

:::tip[Multichain Utilities]
Lucikly, `AbstractJS` makes working with smart contract instances 
across multiple chains extremely easy with the built-in `MultichainContract`
type.

---

:::

In order to load the `AaveV3Pool` contract, we can simply call the 
`getMultichainContract` utility function and load it up with the 
addresses of the AAVE Pool on different chains:

```ts [Multichain Contract]
const mcAaveV3Pool = getMultichainContract({
  abi: parseAbi([
    "function supply(address asset, uint256 amount, address onBehalfOf, uint16 referralCode)",
    "function withdraw(address asset, uint256 amount, address to)"
  ]),
  deployments: [
    ["0x794a61358D6845594F94dc1DB02A252b5b4814aD", optimism.id],
    ["0xA238Dd80C259a72e81d7e4664a9801593F98d1c5", base.id],
    ["0x794a61358D6845594F94dc1DB02A252b5b4814aD", polygon.id],
    ["0x794a61358D6845594F94dc1DB02A252b5b4814aD", arbitrum.id]
  ],
});
```

:::tip[Common Token Exports]
Finding token addresses across many chains is a pain. This is why `AbstractJS` comes
with exports for the 100+ biggest ERC20 tokens.
:::

```ts [Import and Use USDC]
import { mcuSDC } from "./utils/tokens";

const address = mcUSDC.addressOn(optimism.id)

console.log(address)
```

#### Get the Unified Multichain Balance

Use the built-in `getUnifiedERC20Balance` function to fetch the 
unified ERC20 Balance.

```ts
const unifiedBalance = await getUnifiedERC20Balance({
  account: mcNexus,
  mcToken: mcUSD0
})
```
::::

## Execute a Cross-Chain Supply With Intents
::::steps
#### Encode an Intent for Moving Funds to the Target Chain

We'll use a built-in `AbstractJS` function for encoding intents. This function
will make sure that the tokens are transferred from whichever chain they're on
to the target chain. 

:::tip[Intent Solvers and Fillers]
Currently, Biconomy is using Across to provide liquidity to intents. Adding 
additional providers is scheduled to be added to the SDK.
:::

```ts
const supplyAmount = parseUnits('100', 6 ) // 100 USDC

if(unifiedBalance.balance < supplyAmount) {
  console.log("Not enough funds")
}

const intent = await mcNexus.build({
  type: 'intent',
  data: {
    mcToken: mcUSDC,
    amount: supplyAmount,
    chain: optimism
  }
})
```

#### Select Chain for Paying Gas
Working on MEE stack gives developers automatic access to cross-chain 
gas abstraction - meaning you can pay for gas on any chain, while executing
on any other.

In practice - this means that no matter how much transactions we encode across
chains - we'll pay the transaction fee only once and only on one chain.

Here, we will choose the chain with the biggest balance. 

:::tip[Paying in Assets Being Used]
Make sure that you have enough tokens on your account for both the transaction
and the gas.

If you're using USDC as input into a function and also paying for gas 
with USDC - the gas payment transaction is always executed first. So if you're
using the entire balance to pay for gas, the subsequent transactions will fail.
:::

```ts [Selecting Biggest Balance for Gas]
const payingGasOnChain = unifiedBalance.breakdown.reduce((max, current) => {
  return current.balance > max.balance ? current : max;
}).chainId;
```

#### Make Sure to Account for Slippage
When using intents and bridges, the amount you receive on the destination 
will be less than the amount provided. This is due to the fact that Solvers
take fees for executing these cross-chain transfers. 

:::tip[Proper Solution - Composability Stack]
We are developing the Composability Stack - which is a module developers
can install on accounts to dynamically inject the _exact_ amount of funds
which were received from bridging and/or swapping.

The Composability stack will be in production together with the production 
release of the Biconomy MEE stack.

[Learn about the Composability Stack](/composability/using-fallback-handlers)
:::

For now, this tutorial will use a fixed
slippage buffer - a hacky solution - until we add the composability stack
documentation.

```ts
const slippageBuffer = parseUnits('0.5', 6)
```

#### Encode Approve + Execute

Now we will encode two transactions.

1. Approve AAVE to Spend USDC on Optimism
2. Execute Supply

```ts 
const approveSupply: Instruction[] = [
  // Approve tx
  mcUSDC.on(optimism.id).approve({
    args: [
      mcAaveV3Pool.addressOn(optimism.id),
      supplyAmount
    ],
    gasLimit: 100_000n
  }),
  // Supply tx
  mcAaveV3Pool.on(optimism.id).supply({
    args: [
      mcUSDC.addressOn(optimism.id), // asset to supply
      supplyAmount - slippageBuffer, // how much to supply
      zeroAddress, // on behalf of - zeroaddress if supplying for oneself
      0 // referral code
    ],
    gasLimit: 100_000n
  })
]
```

#### Execute Supertransaction
Now let's execute the Supertransaction which supplies to AAVE across chains:

:::tip[Quote + Execute]
The execution process for MEE works by utilizing a Quote + Execute process.

1. The node gives a Quote for the execution price
2. The developer/user checks the price
3. If not-OK, they reject the tx
4. If OK, they accept the tx

We will be using the `execute` method which does the Quote + Execute 
automatically and accepts the best available quote. If you wish to 
have control over the execution price, use different methods. 

[Learn more](/mee/tutorials/execute-simple-supertx)
:::

```ts
const { hash } = await meeClient.execute({
  instructions: [
    ...intent,
    ...approveSupply
  ],
  feeToken: toFeeToken({
    chainId: payingGasOnChain,
    token: mcUSDC
  })
})
```

#### Track the Execution of Your Supertransaction

Use the built-in function to get the link to `MEEScan`

```ts
console.log(
  getMeeScanLink(hash)
)
```

#### Wait for the Supertransaction to Execute

```ts
const receipt = await meeClient.waitForSupertransactionReceipt({
  hash
})
```
::::

## Unwind AAVE Positions on Multiple Chains With a Single Signature
::::steps
#### Fetch AAVE Positions Across Chains

We'll use the `getUnifiedERC20Balance` utility to fetch all aUSDC positions across chains.

```ts [Fetch aUSDC Balances]
const mcAUSDC = getMultichainContract({
  abi: parseAbi([
    "function balanceOf(address owner) view returns (uint256)"
  ]),
  deployments: [
    ["0x625E7708f30cA75bfd92586e17077590C60eb4cD", optimism.id],
    ["0x forced to be brief here - add real address", base.id],
    ["0x625E7708f30cA75bfd92586e17077590C60eb4cD", polygon.id],
    ["0x625E7708f30cA75bfd92586e17077590C60eb4cD", arbitrum.id]
  ],
});

const aUSDCPositions = await getUnifiedERC20Balance({
  account: mcNexus,
  mcToken: mcAUSDC
})

const activePositions = aUSDCPositions.breakdown.filter(p => p.balance > 0n)
```

#### Encode Withdrawal Instructions

For each chain where we have a position, we need to encode two transactions:
1. Approve AAVE Pool to burn our aUSDC
2. Execute the withdrawal

```ts [Encode Withdrawals]
const withdrawalInstructions = activePositions.flatMap(position => ([
  // Approve tx
  mcAUSDC.on(position.chainId).approve({
    args: [
      mcAaveV3Pool.addressOn(position.chainId),
      position.balance
    ],
    gasLimit: 100_000n
  }),
  // Withdraw tx
  mcAaveV3Pool.on(position.chainId).withdraw({
    args: [
      mcUSDC.addressOn(position.chainId),
      position.balance,
      mcNexus.deploymentOn(position.chainId).address
    ],
    gasLimit: 200_000n
  })
]))
```

#### Select Chain for Paying Gas

Let's check USDC balances across chains to choose where to pay gas from.

```ts [Get Unified Balance]
const unifiedBalance = await getUnifiedERC20Balance({
  account: mcNexus,
  mcToken: mcUSDC
})

const payingGasOnChain = unifiedBalance.breakdown.reduce((max, current) => {
  return current.balance > max.balance ? current : max;
}).chainId;
```

#### Execute the Multichain Withdrawal

Now we can execute all of our withdrawal transactions with a single signature:

```ts [Execute Withdrawals]
const { hash } = await meeClient.execute({
  instructions: withdrawalInstructions,
  feeToken: toFeeToken({
    chainId: payingGasOnChain,
    token: mcUSDC
  })
})
```

#### Track the Execution Progress

Just like with supplying, we can track our transaction on MEEScan:

```ts [Get MEEScan Link]
console.log(
  getMeeScanLink(hash)
)

const receipt = await meeClient.waitForSupertransactionReceipt({
  hash
})
```

:::tip[Parallel Execution]
The MEE node will automatically orchestrate the execution of transactions
across different chains in parallel when possible. This means that your
withdrawals will execute as quickly as possible!
