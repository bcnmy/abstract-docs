# 🎬 Getting Started

## ↔ Basic Functionality Guide
Follow this guide to learn how to execute a single-chain (or multi-chain) batch transaction while paying 
for gas in ERC-20 tokens. [Click Here](/new/getting-started/pay-gas-erc20-token).


## 🧩 Composable Orchestration Guide
Follow this guide to learn how to execute composable batch execute calls (even across chains). These are batch
calls where the input of one function call depends on the output of the previous one.

Composable orchestration allows you to combine function calls, bridges and solvers into a single-signature 
cross-chain flow.
