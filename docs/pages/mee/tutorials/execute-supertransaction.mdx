# Execute a Supertransaction

## About Supertransactions

A Supertransaction is an innovative transaction data model, developed
for execution through Modular Execution Environments (MEEs).

## Many chains - single signature

Supertransactions enable developers to put multiple transactions and intents, to
be executed across multiple chains - into a single data structure and
represent it with a single hash.

With a single signature from the user, the entire Supertransaction can
be approved and executed by the MEE Node!

✔️ Fast, intent-based cross-chain execution

✔️ Full flexibility of regular transactions

## Automatic Orchestration

Beyond this, the MEE Node will automatically deduce dependencies
between separate transactions/intents and make sure they're executed
in the correct sequence.

## Executing a Simple Supertransaction

In this example, we'll just cover the steps to executing the most
basic Supertransaction possible. It will not use Orchestration, but
instead - just execute two independent transactions on two chains
with a single user signature.

::::steps

#### Install required dependencies

Install `AbstractJS` and other required dependencies

```bash
npm install @biconomy/abstractjs viem @rhinestone/module-sdk@0.2.3
```

#### Initialize the Multichain Smart Account

Supertransactions use instances of Smart Accounts across multiple
chains. In order to simplify the management of multiple Smart Accounts
across multiple chains, AbstractJS comes with a built in utility type
called `MultichainSmartAccount`. Initialize it by running the code
below:

```ts
const privateKey = "Your Private Key";
const eoa = privateKeyToAccount(privateKey);

// This initialized a Multichain instance of
// a Biconomy Nexus Smart Account.
const mcNexus = await toMultichainNexusAccount({
  // Initialize the Mutlichain Account on Optimism and Arbitrum
  chains: [optimism, arbitrum],
  transports: [http(), http()],
  signer: eoa,
});
```

#### Create the MEE Client

Supertransactions are executed by MEE Nodes - the infrastructure behind
Modular Execution Environments. Create a connection to the MEE Node
in the SDK by running:

```ts
const meeClient = await createMeeClient({
  account: mcNexus,
  url: "https://mee-node.biconomy.io",
});
```

#### Encode a Supertransaction

```ts
const simpleSupertx: SuperTransaction = {
  instructions: [
    // Send 0 USDC on Optimism
    mcUSDC.on(optimism.id).transfer({
      args: [zeroAddress, 0n]
    }),
    // Send 0 USDC on Base
    mcUSDC.on(optimism.id).transfer({
      args: [zeroAddress, 0n],
    }),
  ],
  // Pay for gas with USDC on Optimism
  feeToken: {
    address: mcUSDC.addressOn(optimism.id),
    chainId: optimism.id,
  },
};
```

#### Get a Quote from the MEE Node

In order to execute a Supertransaction, you must get a quote from
one or more MEE Nodes. Within the quote you will get:

- Cryptographic execution commitment from the Node
- Cost of execution in the token you specified in the `feeToken` field

```ts
const quote = await getQuote(meeClient, simpleSupertx);
```

You can check the execution price for the quote and decide whether to
continue with the execution.

```ts
quote.paymentInfo.tokenValue; // Price of execution in USD
quote.paymentInfo.tokenAmount; // Human readable cost (e.g. 1.334 USDC )
quote.paymentInfo.tokenWeiAmount; // Cost in base units (e.g. 1334000)
```

:::tip[Gas Refunds]
The price which you received is the _maximum possible_ price for the
execution of the Supertransaction. The real price will most likely
be lower. The Node refunds all unspent funds to the user.
:::

#### Sign the Quote and Execute the Supertransaction

First sign the Supertransaction quote:

```ts
// This uses the `signer` parameter which we set in the
// `createMeeClient` function to sign the quote
const signedQuote = await signQuote(meeClient, {
  quote,
});
```

Then send for execution to the MEE Node:

```ts
const { hash } = await executeSignedQuote(meeClient, {
  signedQuote,
});
```

#### Wait for the Execution receipt

You can track the Supertransaction execution in the MEE Explorer:

```ts
console.log(
  'MEE Explorer Link: ',
  getMeeScanLink(hash)
)
```

To wait for the Supertransaction to complete:

```ts
const receipt = await waitForSupertransactionReceipt(meeClient, {
  hash: hash,
});
```
