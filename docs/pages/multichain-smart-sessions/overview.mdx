# Smart Sessions Overview

Smart Sessions allow users to delegate specific permissions to external validators, enabling controlled and secure access to your smart account's functionality. This feature now supports operations across multiple blockchain networks.

## Key Concepts

- **Permission Granting**: Account owners can grant specific permissions to other addresses (redeemers)
- **Permission Redemption**: Redeemers can execute transactions on behalf of the account owner within the scope of granted permissions
- **Action Targeting**: Permissions can be limited to specific contract addresses and function selectors
- **Policy Control**: Fine-grained control through action policies like `getSudoPolicy()`, `getTimeLockPolicy()`, `getSpendingLimitsPolicy()`, `getUsageLimitPolicy()`, `getValueLimitPolicy()`
- **Multi-chain Support**: Grant and redeem permissions across different blockchain networks

## How It Works

The Smart Sessions module follows a three-step process:

1. **Installation**: The module is installed on your Nexus account
2. **Grant**: The account owner grants specific permissions to a redeemer address
3. **Redemption**: The redeemer uses the granted permissions to execute transactions

## Technical Architecture

Smart Sessions is implemented as a validator module within the ERC7579-compatible Nexus accounts. Key components include:

- **Smart Sessions Module**: Created with `toSmartSessionsModule()`
- **Session Actions**: Extended functionality via `smartSessionActions()`
- **Session Management**: Methods for granting and using permissions
- **Emulated Accounts**: Allowing redeemers to act on behalf of the original account

## Usage Modes

When redeeming permissions, two modes are available:

- `ENABLE_AND_USE`: Used for the first redemption of a permission
- `USE`: Used for subsequent redemptions of the same permission
