Biconomy Modular Exection Environment is in active development and is planned for production launch at the 
end of Q1/2025! Developers can start integrating the MEE Features while the contracts and modules are being

# Paying for Gas Across Chains

`AbstractJS` enables developers to use native and ERC20 tokens on any supported chain to pay for gas on
any other supported chain.

This means that as long as your user has either native tokens or ERC20 tokens on any chain, they can execute 
transactions on all of them

:::tip[Example]
A user has USDC on Optimism and uses that to pay for the execution of a transaction on Arbitrum
:::

## Guide

This guide will demonstrate how to use USDC on Optimsim to pay for transaction execution on Arbitrum

::::steps
#### Install AbstractJS and viem

```bash [Install AbstractJS]
npm install @biconomy/abstractjs viem
```

#### Initialize the infrastructure
In order to use cross-chain gas features, users need to intialize the [`MultichainSmartAccount`]()
and connect to the Biconomy [MEE Node](/explained/mee).

To learn more about the setup, read our [Building a Chain Abstracted App](/mee/tutorials/build-chainabstracted-app) guide.

```ts [Connect the infrastructure]
// Initialize the MultichainSmartAccount
const mcNexus = await toMultichainNexusAccount({
  chains: [optimism, base, polygon],
  signer: eoaAccount
})

// Connect to the MEE Node
const meeClient = createMeeClient({
  account: mcNexus
})
```

#### Encode a Supertransaction
Cross-chain gas functionalities in `AbstractJS` are achieved by encoding and executing 
[Supertransactions](). 

:::tip[Exported Common Tokens]
Finding token addresses accross many chains can be a pain. This is why `AbstractJS` 
ships with a library of 100+ common ERC20 token contract constants. Import them 
and use in your app:

```ts
import { mcUSDC } from "abstractjs"
```
:::

```ts [Encode a Supertransaction]
// Placeholder call - sends 0 ETH to 0x0000000
const emptyCall: AbstractCall = {
  to: zeroAddress,
  value: 0n,
  gasLimit: 50_000n
}

const crossChainGasSupertx: Supertransaction = {
  instructions: [
    // Transaction on Arbitrum
    { calls: [emptyCall], chainId: arbitrum.id }
  ],
  // Pay for gas with USDC on Optimsim
  feeToken: toFeeToken({
    chainId: optimism.id,
    token: mcUSDC
  })
}
```

#### Get the Execution Quote

Send the Supertransaction to the [MEE Node](/explained/mee) to get the 
quote for the execution of your cross-chain gas Supertransaction.

The quote contains the price for which the MEE Node will
execute the Supertransaction.

:::tip[Maximum Price]
This is the maximum possible price that the MEE Node will
take. If the onchain execution turns out to be cheaper, the 
MEE Node will [refund]() the user.
:::

```ts [Get Quote]
const quote = await getQuote(meeClient, crossChainGasSupertx)

console.log(
  // Human readable token amount, e.g. 1.3 
  quote.paymentInfo.tokenAmount
)
```

#### Execute the Supertransaction

If you're happy with the offered price, sign and execute
the Supertransaction

```ts [Execute Supertransaction]
const { hash } = await executeQuote(meeClient, { quote })
```

#### Wait for the Execution to Complete

Track the execution status of the Supertranaction

```ts [Wait for Receipt]
const receipt = 
  await waitForSupertransactionReceipt(meeClient, { hash })

// Get the link to MEEScan
console.log(getMeeScanLink(hash))
```

To track the transaction go to [MEEScan](https://meescan.biconomy.io) and paste the `hash`.
