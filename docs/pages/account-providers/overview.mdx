# Modular Smart Accounts

The backbone of the Biconomy infrastructure, providing developers with interoperability, execution and user 
experience benefits are - Modular Smart Accounts.

Smart Accounts are based on the [ERC4337](https://www.erc4337.io/) Account Abstraction standard set by the Ethereum
Foundation. They can complement or replace commonly used Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs).

## About Smart Accounts 

Modular Smart Accounts solve for many of the limitations of the traditionally used Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs).

Some core benefits of Modular Smart Contract Accounts (SCAs):

::::steps
#### Pay with Tokens
SCAs enable users to pay for gas with ERC20 tokens

#### Free Transactions
SCAs enable developers to sponsor transactions for their users

#### Login and Sign Transactions with Passkeys 
Users can log-in and sign-transactions with Passkeys, drastically improving their onboarding process

#### Recover Accounts
In case the user loses access to an SCA, they enable many ways to recover that account.

#### Automate Account with Bots and Agents
Developers can delegate account access to a bot or an AI agent. The bot can be constrained with 
various permissions - preventing it from executing unwanted transactions.

## Benefits Unique to the Biconomy Stack
Beyond the core benefits, `AbstractJS` and the Biconomy Modular Execution Environment - enable advanced 
features for developers building in a modern, multi-chain execution environment:

::::steps
#### Hybrid Execution
Execute both transactions and intents and mix and match their execution

#### Lightspeed Transactions
Resource locked accounts for lightspeed cross-chain execution

#### Cross-Chain Transaction Sequencing
Automatically sequence multiple transactions across chains and execute them with a single signature

#### Vendor-Neutral Chain Abstraction
Orchestrate multiple intent, bridge and cross-chain messaging providers

#### Cross-Chain Composability
Compose complex, interdependent function calls without writing smart contracts

## Smart Account Modules

Much of the functionality of Smart Accounts is offered through Account Modules. Biconomy Nexus and other supported
Modular Smart Accounts are based on the [ERC7579](https://erc7579.com/) standard and can accept any module compliant 
with the standard. This is an industry-leading modules standard and has been adopted by most leading Smart Account providers.

:::tip[Choose Industry Leading Standards]
By working on top of an ERC7579 standard, you're ensuring your smart account will be compliant with the most widely used
Smart Account standard.
