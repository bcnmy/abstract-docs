/* This is a quickstart project, showing developers how to use the
 * AbstractJS SDK and a Modular Execution Environment (Biconomy Network)
 * to create a seamless multi-chain, multi-transaction flow which the user
 * approves with just a single signature!
 *
 * This flow will:
 *
 *  1. Transfer the user funds from their EOA to an Orchestrator Nexus Smart Account
 *
 *  2. Approve the bridging contract on Base (the source chain)
 *
 *  3. Call the bridging contract on Base (the source chain)
 *
 *  4. Wait for the funds to arrive on Optimism (the destination chain)
 *
 *  5. Call a Swap on the Uniswap instance of the destination chain, swapping
 *     from USDC to USDT.
 *
 *     Note: The call to the Uniswap Swap function will leverage the Biconomy
 *     Composability Stack - which means that the developer will not provide
 *     a hardcoded value of how much will be swapped (e.g. swapping 10 USDC).
 *     Since the developer can't know *exactly* how much they'll receive from
 *     the bridge they've used - they need to encode the _runtime balance_ of
 *     whichever token they're using. AbstractJS SDK and the Biconomy Composability
 *     stack make this effortless.
 *
 *  6. Call the supply function on the AAVE contract on the destination chain.
 *     Again, by leveraging the Composability stack, we'll inject the exact amount
 *     which was received from the swap on Uniswap - into the "amount" field of the
 *     AAVE _supply_ function.
 *
 *  7. Transfer all of the resulting aUSDT tokens back to the EOA of the user. By doing
 *     this as the last step, the user will have the experience of providing USDC from
 *     their EOA on Base and receiving aUSDT (an AAVE position) on Optimism - all from
 *     their EOA and in a single signature.
 *
 * Note: The Fusion Execution by Biconomy - enables all EOA accounts to get many smart
 * account features.

   * Fusion execution mode. This account will not be directly accessed by the
   * users. Instead, it will be used as a passthrough account - which orchestrates
   * the transaction sequence and then returns all resulting funds back to
   * EOA address, once everything is done.

   * has the hash of all the instructions needed for the orchestration appended
   * to it!
   *
   * This is done in two ways (handled automatically by the SDK):
   *
   *  1. If the token being transferred supports ERC20Permit - then the transaction
   *     can be gasless. Our SDK will encode a signature to approve the Orchestrator
   *     account to spend the specified amount of funds from the EOA. The hash of
   *     orchestration instructions will be encoded in the last field of the ERC20Permit
   *     signature.
   *
   *  2. If the token doesn't support ERC20Permit, then the SDK will encode an `approve`
   *     transaction call for the specified token. This will allow the Orchestrator to
   *     spend the specified amount of tokens, but will not be gasless. The user will
   *     have to have some native token (to cover the cost of this transfer). For all the
   *     other instructions, gas can be abstracted away. In this case, the hash of the
   *     orchestration instructions is appended after the useful callData in the
   *     transaction.
   *
   * By signing the transaction or the ERC20Permit, the user is approving both the
   * transfer from the EOA to the Orchestrator Smart Account *and* all the additional
   * instructions. All validation for this is done onchain!

   *     were infact approved by the user.
   * 
   *  2. TX HASH & ChainID - this tells the MEE Node which transaction contains
   *     the signed payload. The MEE Node will fetch this transaction and use the
   *     payload to validate the orchestration instructions. This is because the 
   *     transaction contains the metadata at the end of the data parameter. Since
   *     the entire transaction is signed, the metadata is signed implicitly together
   *     with the approve transaction. The MEE node can then use that to 
   *     "prove" to the oNexus validator (on every chain) that the user actually
   *     approved certain instructions.
