# Sponsoring Gas Across Multiple Chains

The Biconomy stack enables developers to sponsor user transactions, enabling a seamless 
gas-free user experience for all users. 

Built as an upgrade to our five years of providing gas abstraction infrastructure, the 
current gas sponsorship solution is our most advanced yet.

## In Development

The documentation for multichain transaction sponsoring is in developmnet.

You can reference the [Sponsoring Gas](/tutorials/gasless) article if you'd wish to use our 
legacy solution - using ERC-4337 Bundlers & Paymasters.
