# Composable Instruction Builder

The composable instruction builder is used to make function calls which will 
inject dynamic runtime parameters.

The builder accepts the `abi` of the contract being called, the `chainId`
where the contract is deployed and the `contractAddress`. 

```ts
const composableInstruction = await oNexus.build({
  type: 'composable',
  data: {
    abi: erc20Abi,
    functionName: 'transfer',
    chainId: optimism.id,
    to: '0xTargetTokenAddress',
    args: [
      '0xRecipientAddress',

      // This is dynamically injecting the runtime balance 
      // of TargetToken into the amount parameter. For 
      // example, this can be used to send the *exact* value
      // received from a bridge or a solver to some address
      runtimeERC20BalanceOf({
        targetAddress: oNexus.addressOn(optimism.id, true),
        tokenAddress: '0xTargetTokenAddress'
      })
    ]
  }
})
```
