## Nexus Smart Account and Modules
All of Biconomy Infrastructure is powered by Modular Smart Accounts built on top of the [ERC7579](https://erc7579.com/)
standard. Nexus is our reference implemntation of the standard - providing our clients with an end-to-end solution including
both Smart Account contracts and infrastructure. 

The Nexus Smart Account enables you to execute transactions through our Modular Execution Environment or through
ERC4337 Bundler and Paymaster infrastructure. With support for the modular ERC7579 standard - you can install 
modules on your users accounts - significantly boosting the functionality provided by the Smart Account.

Some common modules are:

- **Passkeys**

  Get rid of seed phrases and enable your users to sign transactions with their fingerprints or other biometrics.

- **Smart Sessions**

  Enable bots or AI agents to automate execution on your account while providing strict guardrails on what they're 
  allowed to execute. Smart Sessions allow you to build complex automation, while giving your users the peace of 
  mind that their funds can't be misappropriated.

- **Resource Locks**

  Enable unified balances and lightning fast cross-chain liquidity fronting with a resource lock module. Apps 
  interacting with users who have resource locks installed can access their funds across multiple chains in a
  fraction of the time it would take to bridge them.
