# Why Choose Biconomy?

Biconomy is the leading solution for building user friendly onchain
apps. Biconomy has been the backbone of onchain UX since 2019. 
If you need a solution which can scale with your app - from a one person startup 
to a category-defining enterprise - choose Biconomy.

## Feature Rich and Battle Tested

* **Easy User Onboarding & Industry-Leading Customer Retention**
  * Login users and sign transactions with [Passkeys](/modules/validators/passkeyValidator/) 
  * Use Social Login (Google, Apple, Phone Number) with providers like [Magic](/tutorials/signers/magic),
   [Privy](/tutorials/signers/privy), [Dynamic](/tutorials/signers/dynamic), 
   [Web3Auth](/tutorials/signers/magic), and many others.

* **Chain Abstraction**
  * Build [chain abstracted apps](/mee/tutorials/build-chainabstracted-app).
  * Build with [multichain smart accounts](/mee/tutorials/manage-multichain-sca).
  * Execute [intents](/mee/tutorials/execute-intent).
  * Orchestrate [multi-chain transaction sequences](/mee/tutorials/build-chainabstracted-app) with a single signature.
  * Use unified multichain balances.

* **Deploy Smart Accounts**
  * Use `AbstractJS` to deploy and manage smart accounts
    * On a single chain, or...
    * ...across multiple chains
  * Use our reference account implementation - [Biconomy Nexus](/overview) - the most gas efficient smart account solution on the market

* **Give smart account capabilities to EOAs**
  * **For apps**: [Batch execute transactions with EOAs](/mee/fusion)

* **Smart Sessions**
  * [Give account access to bots or AI Agents](/tutorials/smart-sessions) while making sure they can
  only call the contracts you've approved.

* **Cross-Chain Composability**
  * Stop cross-chain transactions failing due to slippage. [Use the exact
  amount received from solvers and bridges as the input of a function call](/composability/using-fallback-handlers).
  * [Preserve function context](/composability) between multiple transaction calls


{/* ## Build Chain Abstracted Apps

The Biconomy stack offers developers the ability to treat multiple blockchains as if
they're a single execution environment. In a single signature, users can execute transactions
on multiple chains, move funds from user balances across all chains to where they are needed and
batch execute transactions.

:::info[Powered by the best infrastructure]
Biconomy MEE works with industry-leading Intent and Bridging providers like Across, LiFi, Stargate
and others - providing you with the deepest liqudity, best execution prices and quickest exeuction times.
:::

✔ Subsecond cross-chain execution powered by intents and resource locks

✔ Mix-and-match intents and transactions in the same operation

✔ Pull user funds from multiple chains and multiple tokens in a single transaction

✔ Execute multiple transactions across multiple chains with a single signature

## Use Smart Accounts Directly With EOAs

Biconomy is the only Smart Account provider which has the ability to execute batch
transactions and multi-chain operations for users who are using only an EOA.

Onboarding users to Smart Accounts has many benefits, but also comes with challenges:

- Smart Accounts are not portable (every app has it's own)
- When users deposit to Smart Accounts, it fragments their balances

### No Compromises

With the Biconomy Fusion module, you no longer need to decide between EOAs
and SCAs. The Fusion Module enables EOA users to execute complex multi-step
multi-chain interactions with just their EOA.

With Fusion, EOA users can:
- Approve + execute with a signle signature.
- Bridge + execute on destination chain, with a single signature.
- Execute hundreds of separate transactions (e.g. bulk send) with a single signature
- Have their transactions sponsored or pay for gas with ERC20 tokens.


:::info[EIP7702]
The Fusion Module is not a replacement for EIP7702. As wallets will not allow
apps to upgrade users to EIP7702 and will use their own account standards, the 
Fusion model is the perfect tool to augment the capabilities of both non-7702 and
7702 users.

## Cross-Chain Gas Abstraction 

Sponsor transactions across multiple chains with a single gas tank (coming soon) or pay for gas
with native coins or ERC20 tokens across multiple chains (available now) with our multichain native
infrastructure.

- Sponsor gas across multiple chains with a single gas tank

- A user can pay for the execution of a transaction with funds they have on a different chain. 
For example - pay for the execution of a function on Optimism with USDC on Polygon.


## Cross-Chain Composability

Our Composability stack enables developers to dynamically inject parameters
into function calls - even when those parameters are not known ahead of time.

Examples:

- Trigger a Solver and use the received amount on the destination chain
as the input to a `supply` function on AAVE.

- Swap tokens on Uniswap and use the output amount of tokens as the input
to the next transaction.

- Use a variable from Optimism as the input parameter of a function call
on Base. The variable is read at the _exact_ time of execution of the function
on base.

- Trigger multiple different solvers and bridges and use the cumulative output
of all of them as the input to a function call on a target chain.


## Lightspeed Execution With Intents

Onchain execution is becoming heterogenous - with solvers moving funds and accessing liquidity
across multiple chains in seconds. Transactions, on the other side offer much more flexibility in
interacting with blockchains. Our stack elegantly combines both transactions and intents into a single
data object - allowing you to build without compromises.

:::info[Deepest liquidity and fastest execution]
The Biconomy stack is vendor-neutral when it comes to choosing solvers and solver networks. 

Our SDK
comes pre-built with pluigns for leading solver and briding provides - such as Across and LiFi - ensuring
you get the deepest liqudity and best execution prices.

## Supercharge your Accounts with Account Modules

From Smart Sessions, Passkeys - to TimeLocks, Multisigs and Resource Locks - Biconomy accounts
and SDKs are built to enable developers to effortlessly add new functionality to user accounts.

✔ Build automation bots and AI Agents with secure guardrails using Smart Sessions

✔ Enable users to sign transactions with biometrics (fingerprint, FaceID)

✔ Add resource locks to accounts


## No Vendor Lock-In

All of our infrastructure and tooling supports all major Smart Account providers and all of our 
accounts support all major infrastructure providers. Either choose Biconomy as a full service 
key-in-hand solution or mix-and-match Biconomy accounts, SDK and infrastructure with alternative
Smart Account providers.

✔ Use any account and infrastructure provider you choose
