# 🔁 Atomic and Composable Batch Execute

This tutorial demonstrates how to execute a **fully gas-abstracted, multi-step transaction** on Base using one user signature. No bridging. No leftover tokens. Just one-click UX with **gas paid in USDC** and a guarantee that either **all instructions succeed or none do**.

Unlike regular batch execute, composable batch execution allows developers to use the
output of one function call as the input for the next one. To learn more, read the 
[Runtime Parameter Injection](/new/getting-started/understanding-runtime-injection) guide.

:::tip[Single Chain]
This guide covers single-chain batch execution. The Biconomy stack supports
multi-chain batch execution with a single signature as well. Follow [this guide](/new/getting-started/orchestrate-transactions-across-chains)
to learn how.

:::info[‼️ Using EIP-7702]
This guide focuses on atomic execution from External Wallets though the usage of 
_Fusion Execution_. If you're working with Embedded Wallets - adapt the `toMultichainNexusAccount`,
`.getQuote` and `.execute` steps to work with EIP-7702.

## 🧠 Why Should You Care?

* **No ETH required** for gas — everything is paid in USDC.
* **Lower dropoff** in multi-step flows — users only sign once.
* **Eliminates complexity** — no frontend juggling approvals, swaps, and deposits.
* **Business win**: better UX, fewer support issues, and higher conversion.
* **Full support**: Works for all EOA users, including regular MetaMask, Rabby, Trust, etc...

::::steps
### 🛠️ 2 Setup

Import all the required dependencies.

```ts
import {
  createMeeClient,
  toMultichainNexusAccount,
  UniswapSwapRouterAbi,
  getMeeScanLink,
  runtimeERC20BalanceOf,
  greaterThanOrEqualTo,
} from "@biconomy/abstractjs";

import { http, parseUnits } from "viem";
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";
import { base, optimism } from "viem/chains";
import { balanceNotZeroConstraint } from "../utils/balanceNotZero.util";
```

### 2.1 Create an Orchestrator

An orchestrator is a smart account owned by the user. All instructions are executed
on top of this account.

```ts
const eoa = privateKeyToAccount(Bun.env.PRIVATE_KEY as `0x${string}`);

const orchestrator = await toMultichainNexusAccount({
  chains: [optimism, base],
  transports: [http(), http()],
  signer: eoa,
});
```

:::info[What is Nexus?]
Nexus is the engine behind composable orchestration and gasless execution. It's the most 
gas efficient 
:::

### 2.2 Connect to the Modular Execution Environment (MEE)

Gasless multichain orchestration is enabled by connecting to the
Modular Execution Environment. This is a trustless, globally distributed
network of Relayer nodes executing instructions on top of smart accounts.

```ts
const meeClient = await createMeeClient({ account: orchestrator });
```

## 📑 3 Declare Constants

These are the contract addresses we'll need for this tutorial.

```ts
const UNISWAP_ROUTER_BASE = "0x2626664c2603336E57B271c5C0b26F421741e481";
const USDC_BASE           = "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913";
const WETH_BASE           = "0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006";
const MORPHO_RE7_POOL     = "0xA2Cac0023a4797b4729Db94783405189a4203AFc";

// Change to be whatever you want the input to be.
const inputAmount = parseUnits("10", 6);
```

## 🔨 4 Build Instructions

### 4.1 Approve Uniswap

This will encode an `ERC-20` `approve` function which approves the Uniswap
contract to spend USDC.

```ts
const approveUniswap = await orchestrator.buildComposable({
  type: "approve",
  data: {
    spender: UNISWAP_ROUTER_BASE,
    tokenAddress: USDC_BASE,
    chainId: base.id,
    amount: inputAmount,
  },
});
```

:::info[ℹ️ Helper Function]
This is a helper. You can always encode it manually with `type: "default"` and `erc20Abi` if needed.
:::

### 4.2 Swap USDC → WETH (Runtime Injection)

Using the `.buildComposable` helper, we are encoding a call to the `exactInputSingle` function
on the Uniswap contract. This will swap USDC for USDT.

Note the use of `runtimeERC20BalanceOf` in the `amountIn` field of the call. This means
that we're not predetermining the amount being swapped - we'll use whatever is available
on the orchestrator account. 

```ts
const swapUSDCtoWeth = await orchestrator.buildComposable({
  type: "default",
  data: {
    chainId: base.id,
    abi: UniswapSwapRouterAbi,
    to: UNISWAP_ROUTER_BASE,
    functionName: "exactInputSingle",
    args: [{
      tokenIn:  USDC_BASE,
      amountIn: runtimeERC20BalanceOf({
        tokenAddress: USDC_BASE,
        targetAddress: orchestrator.addressOn(base.id, true),
        constraints: [balanceNotZeroConstraint],
      }),
      tokenOut: WETH_BASE,
      recipient: orchestrator.addressOn(base.id, true),
      fee: 100,
      amountOutMinimum: 0n,
      sqrtPriceLimitX96: 0n,
    }],
  },
});
```

> 🧠 **Runtime injection** lets you defer the exact amount to use until **execution time** — crucial when the actual balance isn’t known upfront.

### 4.3 Approve Morpho

This instruction approves Morpho to spend WETH. Again, not the usage of `runtimeERC20BalanceOf`
function. Since we don't know how much exactly we'll get from a `swap` on Uniswap due to 
slippage - we're working with runtime values. 

Another thing to note is the `constraints` field. It defines the minimum amount of 
WETH on the account before the orchestration will proceed with the approve instruction.

Since the orchestrator account is just a passthoguh, we can assume that the balance is 
`0` before the swap happens - so we can use the built-in `balanceNotZeroConstraint`

```ts
const approveMorpho = await orchestrator.buildComposable({
  type: "approve",
  data: {
    spender: MORPHO_RE7_POOL,
    chainId: base.id,
    tokenAddress: WETH_BASE,
    amount: runtimeERC20BalanceOf({
      tokenAddress: WETH_BASE,
      targetAddress: orchestrator.addressOn(base.id, true),
      constraints: [ balanceNotZeroConstraint ],
    }),
  },
});
```

### 4.4 Deposit WETH into Morpho

Deposit WETH to Morpho. 

Ordering for this function call depends on two factors:
- `balanceNotZeroConstraint` defines that the instruction can't be executed until the 
swap has happened (meaning until the balance of WETH is greater than zero)
- **Implicit Ordering** works here as well. The orchestrator will wait until the approval 
has been set. This is because this transaction will keep simulating a failure until it gets
the approval to spend WETH. So the execution cannot proceed before that happens.

```ts
const supplyWeth = await orchestrator.buildComposable({
  type: "default",
  data: {
    abi: [{
      name: "deposit",
      inputs: [
        { name: "assets",   type: "uint256" },
        { name: "receiver", type: "address" },
      ],
      stateMutability: "nonpayable",
      type: "function",
    }],
    to: MORPHO_RE7_POOL,
    chainId: base.id,
    functionName: "deposit",
    args: [
      runtimeERC20BalanceOf({
        tokenAddress: WETH_BASE,
        targetAddress: orchestrator.addressOn(base.id, true),
        constraints: [balanceNotZeroConstraint],
      }),
      orchestrator.addressOn(base.id, true),
    ],
  },
});
```

## 🚦 5 Quote & Execute (Fusion)

### 5.1 Create the Fusion trigger

In order for the orchestrator account to "pull" the funds for orchestration, we must
give it an approval to do so. This is done by the `trigger` param. It tells the orchestrator
which token on which chain and which amount to approve.

[Read more about triggers](/new/getting-started/enable-mee-eoa-users#fusion-mode-orchestration-external-wallets) 

```ts
const trigger: Trigger = {
  chainId: base.id,
  tokenAddress: USDC_BASE,
  amount: inputAmount,
};
```

### 5.2 Quote the cost

```ts
const quote = await meeClient.getFusionQuote({
  trigger,
  feeToken: { address: USDC_BASE, chainId: base.id },
  instructions: [approveUniswap, swapUSDCtoWeth, approveMorpho, supplyWeth],
});
```

### 5.3 Execute the flow

```ts
const { hash } = await meeClient.executeFusionQuote({ fusionQuote: quote });
console.log(`Explorer: ${getMeeScanLink(hash)}`);
```

---

## 🧾 6 Confirm Atomic Completion

```ts
const receipt = await meeClient.waitForSupertransactionReceipt({ hash });
console.log("Batch complete:", receipt);
```

> ✅ All instructions succeed, or none are processed. Fully atomic.

## 📝 Checklist Before Production

* [ ] Replace `amountOutMinimum: 0n` with real slippage.
* [ ] Dial in `gasLimit`s to optimize quotes.
* [ ] Add cleanup `transfer` if leftover tokens aren’t desired.
* [ ] Monitor quote accuracy vs. actual gas used.

Enjoy full-chain composability 🎯
