# Beyond Account Abstraction: ERC-4337 vs. MEE

## The Evolution of Blockchain Infrastructure

ERC-4337 introduced account abstraction, significantly improving blockchain UX. However, as applications grow in complexity and users operate across multiple chains, developers have encountered limitations that Modular Execution Environments (MEE) are designed to solve.

## Real-World Scenarios: Where ERC-4337 Falls Short

### Cross-Chain Investor: Priya

**Scenario:** Priya wants to bridge USDC from Ethereum to Arbitrum, swap for different tokens on Arbitrum, and provide liquidity.

**With ERC-4337:**
- Multiple separate transactions across chains
- Multiple signatures required
- Manual monitoring of bridge completion
- Managing gas on each chain independently

**With MEE:**
- One signature for the entire flow
- Automatic detection of bridge completion
- Seamless continuation of operations on destination chain
- Payment for all gas using any supported token

### Business Owner: Sam

**Scenario:** Sam needs to pay team members monthly across multiple chains.

**With ERC-4337:**
- No native support for scheduling transactions
- No mechanism for recurring payments
- Each payment cycle requires new signatures
- Each chain requires separate management

**With MEE:**
- Schedule all payments in advance
- Set up recurring execution patterns
- Pay team members across any supported chain
- Use a single gas token for all payments

## Key Advantages of MEE Over ERC-4337

### 1. True Composability

**ERC-4337:** Limited to static batching where all calldata must be known upfront. Transactions within a batch cannot use the results of previous steps.

**MEE:** Enables dynamic execution where each step can reference outputs from previous steps. This allows for conditional execution, runtime calculations, and complex transaction flows even on a single chain.

### 2. Cross-Chain Orchestration

**ERC-4337:** Limited to single-chain operations. Cross-chain activities require multiple separate transactions with separate signatures.

**MEE:** Natively orchestrates operations across chains, handling dependencies and timing considerations automatically. A single signature can authorize a complex flow spanning multiple chains.

### 3. Universal Gas Abstraction

**ERC-4337:** Supports paying gas in tokens on a single chain, but each chain's operations require separate gas management.

**MEE:** Allows paying for gas on any chain using tokens from any other supported chain. A single gas tank can fund operations across all chains.

### 4. Transaction Scheduling and Automation

**ERC-4337:** No native support for scheduling or recurring transactions.

**MEE:** Supports scheduling transactions for future execution and setting up recurring execution patterns, enabling automation of complex workflows.

## Capability Comparison

| Capability | ERC-4337 | MEE |
|------------|----------|-----|
| **Transaction Execution** | | |
| Simple batch transactions | ✅ | ✅ |
| Dynamic composable transactions | ❌ | ✅ |
| Output-to-input references | ❌ | ✅ |
| Transaction scheduling | ❌ | ✅ |
| Recurring transactions | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Gas Management** | | |
| Pay gas in tokens (single chain) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Pay gas in tokens (cross-chain) | ❌ | ✅ |
| Unified gas sponsorship | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Wallet Support** | | |
| Smart contract wallets | ✅ | ✅ |
| EOA wallets | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Multi-Chain Support** | | |
| Single-chain operations | ✅ | ✅ |
| Cross-chain orchestration | ❌ | ✅ |
| Bridge completion detection | ❌ | ✅ |
| Chain-agnostic development | ❌ | ✅ |

## Beyond the Technical: Use Cases Enabled by MEE

MEE enables new user experiences that would be impractical with ERC-4337:

1. **Cross-Chain DeFi Strategies**  
   Bridge assets to highest-yielding chains, swap to required assets, and deposit into protocols with a single signature.

2. **Conditional Asset Management**  
   Create execution flows based on price conditions, bridge completions, or yield opportunities across multiple chains.

3. **Autonomous Agent Workflows**  
   Authorize agents to execute strategies within user-defined boundaries without requiring multiple signatures.

## Conclusion

ERC-4337 was a critical stepping stone for blockchain UX. MEE builds directly on this foundation, preserving all benefits while solving fundamental limitations in composability and cross-chain orchestration.

MEE isn't replacing ERC-4337—it's fulfilling its vision of making blockchain interactions seamless across the increasingly fragmented chain landscape, benefiting both developers and users with simpler, more powerful transaction capabilities.
