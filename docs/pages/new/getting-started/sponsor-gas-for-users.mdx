# ‚õΩÔ∏è Gas Sponsorship with Biconomy MEE

:::warning[‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites]
This tutorial assumes you've read the:
[Enable MEE for EOA Users](/new/getting-started/enable-mee-eoa-users) and understand 
EIP-7702 based execution and Fusion execution.
:::

Gas sponsorship in Biconomy MEE allows developers to fully abstract gas costs from end-users‚Äîregardless of wallet type or chain. Whether you're building on embedded wallets with EIP-7702, using native smart contract accounts, or orchestrating through Fusion from EOAs like MetaMask, MEE provides a unified, scalable sponsorship model.

:::success[‚úÖ Simplify Your Operations]
One gas tank. Many chains. Sponsorships can be powered across **all supported chains** from a single gas tank and infrastructure.
:::

This guide will:

* Introduce sponsorship across EIP-7702, Fusion, and native SCAs
* Help you choose the right flow for your app
* Walk you through enabling sponsorship
* Explain hosted vs self-hosted setups

## üß† Sponsorship Basics

Biconomy‚Äôs gas sponsorship abstracts the need for end-users to hold native gas. This is ideal for:

* Onboarding users unfamiliar with wallets
* Consumer apps where gas UX is a blocker
* Advanced orchestrations involving bridging or multicalls

Sponsorship is activated per-project via [dashboard.biconomy.io](https://dashboard.biconomy.io) and requires an `apiKey` in all requests.

## üß≠ Choosing the Right Flow

| Wallet Type      | Flow              | Sponsorship Ready? | Notes                                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Embedded Wallets | EIP-7702          | ‚úÖ Easy             | Best UX, full smart account delegation            |
| External EOAs    | Fusion            | ‚ö†Ô∏è Conditional     | Requires permit-supporting tokens or fallback gas |
| Native SCAs      | SCA Orchestration | ‚úÖ Flexible         | Best for apps controlling deployment              |

## üîπ EIP-7702 Sponsorship (Embedded Wallets)

EIP-7702 lets you install smart account logic **directly on EOAs**, enabling orchestration and sponsorship with zero user effort.

```ts
const quote = await meeClient.getQuote({
  sponsorship: true,
  instructions: [/* your calls here */],
  delegate: true,
  authorization // Required for 7702 accounts
});
```

:::success[‚úÖ Full Support]
Supports all ERC-20s, multichain execution, and full transaction abstraction.
:::

:::info[‚ÑπÔ∏è Best For]
**Embedded wallets** (Privy, Dynamic, Turnkey, ...)
:::
## üî∏ Fusion Sponsorship (External Wallets)

Fusion enables orchestration from EOAs (e.g. MetaMask) via a **trigger + Companion Account** pattern. It supports sponsorship, but with caveats:

### üîê Requirements

* Set `sponsorship: true`
* Trigger token **must support `permit()` (ERC-2612)** to be truly gasless
* Otherwise, user must have enough native gas to `approve()` token transfer

```ts
const quote = await meeClient.getFusionQuote({
  sponsorship: true,
  trigger: {
    amount: 1n,
    chainId: base.id,
    tokenAddress: usdcAddresses[base.id]
  },
  instructions: [/* your calls here */]
});
```

:::info[Best For]
External Wallets - MetaMask, Trust, Rabby, Coinbase Wallet, Uniswap Wallet, ...
:::

## üî∏ Native SCA Sponsorship (Deployed Accounts)

If you‚Äôre orchestrating via **pre-deployed smart contract accounts**, you can sponsor transactions as long as the orchestrator account is set and you pass the `apiKey`.

```ts
const quote = await meeClient.getQuote({
  sponsorship: true,
  instructions: [instruction]
});
```

‚úÖ Works across any chain MEE supports. Best for dApps that deploy user accounts up front.



## üèó Hosted vs Self-Hosted Sponsorship

### üß° Biconomy-Hosted

* No infra required
* Uses Biconomy-managed gas tanks
* Set up via dashboard
* Supports post-paid modes with enterprise contracts or paying via credit card

```ts
const meeClient = await createMeeClient({
  account: orchestrator,
  apiKey: "your_project_api_key"
});
```

### üî∏ Self-Hosted

* Run your own sponsorship backend
* Fully programmable: accept or reject transactions based on any custom logic
* Define your own gas tank and token

```ts
sponsorshipOptions: {
  url: "https://your-custom-backend",
  gasTank: {
    address: "0x...",
    token: "0x...",
    chainId: 84532
  }
}
```

‚úÖ Ideal for wallets, infra providers, or apps needing custom user-based policies.



## üß™ Testnet Setup

On testnets, you'll often want to use `sponsorshipOptions` to point to a testnet gas tank:

```ts
const quote = await meeClient.getQuote({
  sponsorship: true,
  sponsorshipOptions: {
    url: DEFAULT_PATHFINDER_URL,
    gasTank: {
      address: DEFAULT_MEE_TESTNET_SPONSORSHIP_PAYMASTER_ACCOUNT,
      token: DEFAULT_MEE_TESTNET_SPONSORSHIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
      chainId: DEFAULT_MEE_TESTNET_SPONSORSHIP_CHAIN_ID
    }
  },
  instructions: [instruction]
});
```



## üîç Discover Available Gas Tanks

List available tanks using:

```http
GET https://network.biconomy.io/v1/sponsorship/info
```

Or point to your self-hosted sponsorship URL to list custom tanks.



## ‚úÖ Summary

* **Use EIP-7702** for embedded wallets ‚Äî simplest and most powerful
* **Use Fusion** for EOAs ‚Äî ensure `permit()` or fallback gas is available
* **Use native SCAs** if deploying and managing accounts
* Start with **Biconomy-hosted sponsorship**; move to self-hosted as you scale
* Sponsorship unlocks full UX abstraction with **one gas tank** across **all chains**
