# What is MEE?

## The Problem You Know Too Well

You've built an amazing DeFi feature. It works perfectly... in your tests. Then real users try it:

- **Transaction 1**: "Please approve spending"
- **Transaction 2**: "Now execute the swap"  
- *Needs to fund wallet with gas on destination chain*
- **Transaction 3**: "Approve on the destination chain"
- **User**: *closes tab*

A customer lost due to the limiations of current Web3 UX. 

Biconomy is here to solve it!

## Enter the Modular Execution Environment

MEE is Biconomy's infrastructure that lets you orchestrate complex blockchain operations with a single user signature. Think of it as a transaction compiler - you write high-level intents, MEE handles all the messy blockchain details.

```typescript
// Before MEE: Multiple transactions, multiple signatures
await token.approve(spender, amount)  // Sign 1
await protocol.deposit(amount)         // Sign 2
await bridge.transfer(chainB, amount)  // Sign 3
// ... user already left

// With MEE: One signature, complete flow
await meeClient.execute({
  instructions: [approveAndDepositAndBridge],
  feeToken: { address: ANY_TOKEN_USER_HAS }  // Even LP tokens!
})
```

## How It Works

MEE operates through a network of orchestrator nodes that:

1. **Accept a single signature** from the user
2. **Execute multiple operations** across chains  
3. **Handle all timing and dependencies** (bridges, async operations)

Your users sign once. MEE handles everything else.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Composable Instructions
Chain operations together like Lego blocks. Each instruction can use outputs from previous ones.

```typescript
const instructions = [
  swap(USDC → USDT),              // Output: USDT amount
  deposit(/* uses USDT amount */), // Output: aTokens
  bridge(/* uses aTokens */)       // To another chain
]
```

### 2. Universal Gas Abstraction
Users can pay with **any valuable token** - not just native gas tokens.

- ✅ Stablecoins (USDC, USDT)
- ✅ LP tokens from Uniswap/Curve
- ✅ Yield-bearing tokens (aUSDC, stETH)
- ✅ Literally any ERC-20 with value

### 3. Cross-Chain Orchestration
Single signature, multiple chains. MEE handles bridge timing, confirmations, and execution.

```typescript
// This just works
await meeClient.execute({
  instructions: [
    operationOnOptimism,
    bridgeToBase,
    operationOnBase,
    bridgeToArbitrum,
    finalOperationOnArbitrum
  ]
})
```

### 4. Runtime Parameter Injection
Handle dynamic values that aren't known until execution time.

```typescript
supply({
  amount: runtimeERC20BalanceOf({
    token: USDT,
    minBalance: parseUnits('100', 6)  // Safety constraints
  })
})
```

## Why Developers Choose MEE

### Ship Features, Not Infrastructure
- Write business logic in TypeScript
- No smart contract deployments
- Update logic without audits
- Test locally with mainnet forks

### 10x Better DevEx
```typescript
// Old way: 500 lines of Solidity across 3 contracts
// New way: 50 lines of TypeScript
const strategy = async (ctx) => {
  await ctx.compose('abi', { /* your logic */ })
}
```

### Your Users Will Thank You
- **Industry leading conversion rates**
- **One-click everything** (even complex DeFi strategies)
- **Never "out of gas"** (pay with tokens they have)
- **Automatic cleanup** (unused funds always returned)

## Integration in 5 Minutes

```typescript
import { createMeeClient, toMultichainNexusAccount, getMEEVersion, MEEVersion } from "@biconomy/abstractjs"

// 1. Create account
const account = await toMultichainNexusAccount({
  signer: userWallet,
  chainConfigurations: [
    {
      chain: optimism,
      transport: http(),
      version: getMEEVersion(MEEVersion.V2_1_0)
    },
    {
      chain: base,
      transport: http(),
      version: getMEEVersion(MEEVersion.V2_1_0)
    },
    {
      chain: arbitrum,
      transport: http(),
      version: getMEEVersion(MEEVersion.V2_1_0)
    }
  ],
})

// 2. Create client
const meeClient = await createMeeClient({ account })

// 3. Execute anything
const { hash } = await meeClient.execute({
  instructions: [...],  // Your orchestrated flow
  feeToken: { address: USER_PREFERRED_TOKEN }
})
```

## The Bottom Line

Every signature you don't ask for is a user you keep. Every chain boundary you hide is friction removed. Every gas token hunt you eliminate is a transaction completed.

MEE isn't just infrastructure - it's how you ship Web3 products that users actually want to use.
