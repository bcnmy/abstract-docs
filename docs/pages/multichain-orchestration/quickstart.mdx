# QuickStart: Asynchronous Composable Orchestration
This will be a short, zero-to-hero guide for building an orchestration flow. It will
demonstrate the following features of the Biconomy stack: <br/><br/>
- **Orchestration** <br/>
The ability for the Biconomy stack to properly sequence multiple transactions across one or
more chains. <br/><br/>
- **Single-Signature Executeion** <br/>
The ability to execute multiple transactions across multiple chains with a single
user signature. <br/><br/>
- **Application-Layer Composability** <br/>
The ability to use the output or a state-change of one onchain function call as the
input for the next one. For example, using the *exact* amount received from a DEX at
runtime, as the input for the *supply* function of a lending platform in the next
step. <br/><br/>
- **Asynchronous Execution** <br/>
The ability to wait for briges, solver or any other asynchronous actions to complete.
E.g. the transaction on Optimism cannot continue until tokens have been bridged from
Base to Optimsim. <br/><br/>

- **Multichain Gas Abstraction** <br/>
With the Biconomy stack, you can pay for execution of transactions on _any_ chain
with ERC-20 tokens on any other chain. Additionally, when executing multiple transactions
across multiple chains - the user pays only one fee on only one chain.

## Example Case
In this example case, we'll:
:::steps
#### Bridge
Call Across bridge to move USDC from Optimism to Base.
Function calls being executed:
- Call `approve` on USDC contract on Optimism (approve spend to Across)
- Call `depositV3` on Across Spoke Pool contract
#### Swap
Use the *exact* amount received from Across to swap to USDT on Base
- Call `approve` on USDC contract on Base (approve spend to Uniswap)
- Call `swap` on Uniswap on Base
:::

:::tip[Simple Demo Case]
While bridge + swap is an interesting application of the Biconomy stack, the real
power comes in orchestrating multiple instructions - for example "swap on source chain,
bridge to destination, swap on destination, then supply to lending protocol".

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- Private key for testing (never use production keys in test code)
- Some USDC on Optimism in your account

::::steps
#### Setup

First, install the required packages:

```bash
npm install @biconomy/abstractjs viem @rhinestone/module-sdk@0.2.7
```

Create a new file and add the basic imports:

```javascript
import {
  createMeeClient,
  toMultichainNexusAccount,
  runtimeERC20BalanceOf,
  greaterThanOrEqualTo,
  mcUSDC,
  mcUSDT
} from "@biconomy/abstractjs";
import { http, parseUnits, encodeFunctionData, erc20Abi } from "viem";
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";
import { optimism, base } from "viem/chains";
```

#### Initialize Smart Account

Set up a multichain smart account on both Optimism and Base:

```javascript
// Set up account (use environment variables in production)
const eoa = privateKeyToAccount("0x...your_private_key...");

// Create multichain smart account
const smartAccount = await toMultichainNexusAccount({
  signer: eoa,
  chains: [optimism, base],
  transports: [http(), http()]
});

// Initialize the orchestration client
const meeClient = await createMeeClient({
  account: smartAccount
});

console.log("Smart account address on Optimism:", smartAccount.addressOn(optimism.id));
console.log("Smart account address on Base:", smartAccount.addressOn(base.id));
```

#### Important: Fund the Account
This example is using _Smart Account_ based orchestration.  In order for smart account based orchestration
to work, you need to put funds into the smart account.

:::info[Note]
The Biconomy stack supports orchestration from Native EOAs as well. 
Read the [Native EOA Guide](/multichain-orchestration/eoa).
:::

#### Define Bridge Instruction

```javascript
// Import the Across bridge helper function
import { prepareAcrossBridgeTransaction } from "./across-encoder";

// Define the amount to bridge
const amountToBridge = parseUnits("5", 6); // 5 USDC


// Build the bridge instruction
const bridgeInstruction = await smartAccount.buildComposable({
  type: "default",
  data: // Encode call to bridge instructions here
});
```

#### Define Runtime Value Injection

Runtime value injection allows function parameters to be determined at execution time rather than when creating the transaction. This is essential for cross-chain operations where exact amounts can't be known in advance due to bridge fees, slippage, or other factors.

When using `runtimeERC20BalanceOf`, the system will:
1. Read the actual token balance at execution time
2. Inject this value into the function parameters
3. Apply any constraints to ensure sufficient value

```javascript
// Define execution constraints (minimum amount to accept from bridge)
const executionConstraints = [
  greaterThanOrEqualTo((amountToBridge * 90n) / 100n) // Accept 10% slippage
];

// Approve USDC spend to Uniswap on Base using the approve instruction builder
const approveUsdcToUniswap = await smartAccount.buildComposable({
  type: "approve",
  data: {
    chainId: base.id,
    tokenAddress: mcUSDC.addressOn(base.id),
    spender: uniswapRouter,
    // Use the exact amount received from the bridge
    amount: runtimeERC20BalanceOf({
      targetAddress: smartAccount.addressOn(base.id),
      tokenAddress: mcUSDC.addressOn(base.id),
      constraints: executionConstraints
    })
  }
});
```

#### Define Swap Instruction

```javascript
import { parseAbi } from 'viem'

const uniswapRouterAbi = parseAbi([
  "function exactInputSingle((address tokenIn, address tokenOut, uint24 fee, address recipient, uint256 amountIn, uint256 amountOutMinimum, uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96)) returns (uint256 amountOut)"
]);

// Uniswap router address on Base
const uniswapRouter = "0x2626664c2603336E57B271c5C0b26F421741e481";
 
// Execute swap on Uniswap
const swapOnUniswap = await smartAccount.buildComposable({
  type: "default",
  data: {
    chainId: base.id,
    abi: uniswapRouterAbi,
    to: uniswapRouter,
    functionName: "exactInputSingle",
    args: [{
      tokenIn: mcUSDC.addressOn(base.id),
      tokenOut: mcUSDT.addressOn(base.id),
      fee: 500, // 0.05% fee tier
      recipient: smartAccount.addressOn(base.id),
      // Use the exact amount of USDC received from the bridge
      amountIn: runtimeERC20BalanceOf({
        targetAddress: smartAccount.addressOn(base.id),
        tokenAddress: mcUSDC.addressOn(base.id),
        constraints: executionConstraints
      }),
      amountOutMinimum: 0n, // For demo purposes, set proper slippage in production
      sqrtPriceLimitX96: 0n // No price limit
    }]
  }
});
```

#### Execute the Orchestration

```javascript
// Execute the orchestration sequence
const { hash } = await meeClient.execute({
  // Pay for execution with USDC on Optimism
  feeToken: {
    address: mcUSDC.addressOn(optimism.id),
    chainId: optimism.id
  },
  // The sequence of instructions to execute
  instructions: [
    bridgeInstruction,
    approveUsdcToUniswap,
    swapOnUniswap
  ]
});

console.log(`Orchestration started: ${hash}`);

```

#### Wait for Execution Result

```ts
// Wait for the entire orchestration to complete
const receipt = await meeClient.waitForSupertransactionReceipt({ hash });
console.log("Orchestration completed successfully!");

```

::::

## How It Works

1. **Smart Account Initialization**: <br/>
We create a multichain smart account that can operate on both Optimism and Base.

2. **Bridge Execution**: 
   - The bridge instruction runs on Optimism
   - It approves USDC spending and calls Across bridge

3. **Asynchronous Waiting**:
   - After the bridge instruction completes, the system automatically waits for funds to arrive on Base
   - No manual monitoring or intervention required

4. **Runtime Value Injection**:
   - When funds arrive on Base, the exact received amount is automatically injected into the next instructions
   - The `runtimeERC20BalanceOf` function reads the actual token balance at execution time
   - This handles any slippage from the bridge operation

5. **Constraint Enforcement**:
   - The execution constraints ensure the swap only proceeds if a minimum amount was received
   - If less than 90% of the expected amount arrives, the swap won't execute

6. **Swap Execution**:
   - Once sufficient funds are available on Base, the USDC is approved for Uniswap
   - The swap executes using exactly the amount received from the bridge

## Key Points

- The entire orchestration is executed with a single signature from the smart account
- No need to manually monitor bridge status or handle cross-chain coordination
- Runtime values automatically adapt to actual on-chain conditions
- Execution constraints provide safety guardrails for the operation
- The orchestration handles the asynchronous nature of bridges transparently
