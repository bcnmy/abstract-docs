# EIP-7702 Overview

## Why EIP-7702
EIP-7702 is an upcoming upgrade to Ethereum and EVM blockchains which enables
wallets to convert the user EOA wallets into Smart Accounts

With EIP-7702, wallets can drastically improve the UX for their users by offering smart
account features, such as:

---

**Gas Abstraction** <br/>
The ability to pay for gas with ERC20 tokens

---

**Gas Sponsorship** <br/>
Wallets can sponsor user gas onchain and offer their users a different way of paying for their
transactions (e.g. prepaid, postpaid, ...)

---

**Batch Execution** <br/>
The ability to batch execute transactions with a single signature

---

**Enable Automation** <br/>
Wallets can install (or enable apps to install) Session Keys on accounts, which provide a
safe way to automate wallet actions. Session keys provide guardrails, meaning that the Session Key
signer can only execute the exact transactions approved by the wallet/user. This can include enabling
dollar cost averaging, TWAP selling, yield rebalancing, ...


## The Most Comprehensive EIP-7702 Solutions Suite

At Biconomy, we have built the most comprehensive EIP-7702 solution on the market, enabling
wallets to add all of the above mentioned features, as well as many advanced - Biconomy 
stack specific features:

**Unified User Balances** <br/>
Wallets can present apps with a _Unified Multichain Balance_. The app can then "pull" the 
funds they need to the chain of their choosing. Wallets can work with solvers and bridges
to provide this liquidity.

--- 

**Cross-Chain Gas Abstraction** <br/>
Wallets can enable users to pay for gas with native or ERC20 tokens across chains. E.g. a
user can pay for a transaction on Base with USDC or ETH on Arbitrum.

--- 

**Native Scheduling and Automation** <br/>
The Biconomy MEE Nodes can commit to execute a transaction at some point in the future or to
execute a series of transactions in some time period. For Biconomy integrators, this is available
without installing a separate module.

## Quickstart Guide for Developers

::::steps
#### Install Packages
Install `AbstractJS` TypeScript SDK and viem 

```bash
npm install @biconomy/abstractjs viem @rhinestone/module-sdk@0.2.7
```

#### Sign a wallet authorization
In order add Smart Account capabilities to an EOA account, you must sign an authorization specifying which
Smart Account address will be "installed" on the EOA address. In order to save on gas costs, you will be setting
the authorization to a singleton contract - which means that no new contracts will need to be deployed.  


```ts
// This is the address of the EOA to which 
// address we'll be "installing" the smart account to.
const eoa = privateKeyToAccount('0xPrivateKey')

// Create an instance of a viem wallet client and extend it with the 
// required EIP-7702 actions.
const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  chain: odysseyTestnet,
  account: eoa,
  transport: http(),
}).extend(EIP-7702Actions())

const authorization = await walletClient.signAuthorization({
  // Address of the Nexus Proxy Singleton
  contractAddress: nexusProxyAddress 
})
```

#### Choose your execution environment

With `AbstractJS` and the Biconomy stack, developers can choose whether to 
push transactions through our battle-tested [ERC4337 Bundler/Paymaster stack](/explained/bundlers-paymasters) *or*
through our innovative multi-chain [MEE Stack](/explained/mee)
::::

{/* ## Execute through the ERC4337 Bundler/Paymaster Stack



## Execute through the MEE Stack

::::steps
#### Follow tutorial

Follow all the instructions for authorizing Nexus as your Smart Account at
the beginning of this tutorial.

#### Initialize the Modular Execution Environment

```ts
const meeClient = await createMeeClient({
  nodeUrl: 'https://mee-node.biconomy.io'
})
```

#### Set up the Smart Account
Initialize the Smart Account you will be using for delegation. In this case, we'll
be using Biconomy Nexus.

```ts
const account = await toMultichainNexusAccount({
  chains: [odysseyTestnet],
  transports: [http()],
  signer: eoa,
  // Override the address of the account to the EOA address
  accountAddress: eoa.address
})
```

#### Execute a Supertransaction

```ts
const quote = await getQuote(meeClient, {
  instructions: [
    {
      calls: [
        { to: zeroAddress, value: 0n }
      ],
      chainId: optimism.id
    }
  ],
  feeToken: mcUSDC.on(optimism.id)
})

const hash = await executeQuote(meeSerivice, quote)
```
