## Bundlers and Paymasters

Our battle-tested legacy infrastructure eliminates core friction points in blockchain interaction. Through batch
execution, users can conveniently perform multiple operations in a single transaction - whether that's approving
and swapping tokens or executing a complex DeFi strategy, all with just one signature. 

By enabling gas sponsorships,
companies can now fully cover their users' transaction costs, creating truly frictionless Web3 experiences.
Users also gain the flexibility to pay gas fees in any ERC20 token they already hold, removing the traditional
requirement to maintain native token balances across chains. The stack seamlessly integrates with all major
smart account providers, letting developers enhance their existing infrastructure while delivering these
powerful benefits to their users without disruptive changes to their codebase.


## Code highlight - Executing a Sponsored Transaction

```ts
const bundlerUrl = "https://bundler.biconomy.io/api/v3/84532/nJPK7B3ru.dd7f7861-190d-41bd-af80-6877f74b8f44";

const nexusClient = await createNexusClient({
    signer: account,
    chain: baseSepolia,
    transport: http(),
    bundlerTransport: http(bundlerUrl),
    paymaster: createBicoPaymasterClient({paymasterUrl})
}); // [!code focus:7]

// Execute a gas sponsored transaction
const hash = await nexusClient.sendTransaction({ calls:  
    [{to : '0xf5715961C550FC497832063a98eA34673ad7C816', value: parseEther('0')}] },
); 
console.log("Transaction hash: ", hash) 
const receipt = await nexusClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({ hash });
