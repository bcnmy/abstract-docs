Biconomy Modular Execution Environment is in active development and is planned for production launch at the 
end of Q1/2025! Developers can start integrating the MEE Features while the contracts and modules are being

# Execute a Simple Supertransaction

In this tutorial, we will use the Biconomy Modular Execution Environment to execute a very 
simple [Supertransaction](/explained/mee#supertransactions-the-innovation-under-the-hood).

## Goals

The goal of this tutorial is to learn the flow of executing 
a Supertransaction. This tutorial will not cover the functionalities
which Supertransactions unlock - such as multichain orchestration,
intent execution or cross-chain gas abstraction.

## Getting Started

::::steps
#### Install AbstractJS and viem

```bash [Install]
npm install @biconomy/abstractjs viem @rhinestone/module-sdk@0.2.7
```

#### Initialize the MEE Infrastructure
Supertransactions are powered by the Biconomy Modular Execution
Environment (MEE). To connect to MEE, we need to initialize 
an `meeClient`

```ts [Initialize Infrastructure]
// Create an account owner - signer
const eoaSigner = privateKeyToAccount("Your private key here")

// Create a connector to Biconomy Nexus account
// implementations across multiple chains
// with the multichain account utility function
const mcNexus = await toMultichainNexusAccount({
  chains: [optimism, base, polygon, arbitrum],
  transports: [http(), http(), http(), http()],
  signer: eoaSigner
})

// Create the connection to the MEE
const meeClient = await createMeeClient({
  account: mcNexus
})
```

#### Encode a Dummy Transaction
For the purposes of this tutorial, we'll encode a dummy
transaction which simply send 0ETH to `0x000000...`

```ts [Dummy Transaction]
const emptyTx: AbstractCall = {
  to: zeroAddress,
  value: 0n
}
```

#### Encode a Supertransaction
Now we will encode an instance of the Supertransaction 
object. The Supertransaction object contains two fields:

1. **Instructions** - which function calls need to be 
executed and on which chains

2. **Fee Token** - which native or ERC20 token and on which
chain will be used to pay for the Supertransaction

```ts [Encode Supertransaction]
const supertransaction: Supertransaction = {
  // Transactions to be executed within a
  // Supertransaction
  instructions: [
    mcNexus.build({ type: "default", data: { chainId: optimism.id, calls: [emptyTx] } }),
  ],
  // Token to pay for the Supertransaction
  feeToken: {
    chainId: optimism.id,
    address: mcUSDC.addressOn(optimism.id)
  }
}
```

#### Executing the Supertransaction 
The way Supertransaction execution goes is as follows:

1. The user sends the Supertransaction to the MEE Node
2. The MEE node gives back a quote - saying for how much it's willing to execute the Supertransaction
3. The user either confirms or declines the quote

#### Getting a Quote from the MEE Node

In order to get the Quote from the MEE Node, we call the 
`getQuote` function:

```ts [Get Quote]
const quote = await meeClient.getQuote(supertransaction)
```

#### Checking the Execution Cost

Check the cost of the execution from the quote given by the 
MEE Node:

```ts [Check Execution Cost]
quote.paymentInfo.tokenValue // execution price in USD (from chainlink feed)
quote.paymentInfo.tokenWeiAmount // execution price in token base units
quote.paymentInfo.tokenAmount // execution price in token decimal units
```

#### Execute the Supertransaction

If you're OK with the quoted execution cost, execute the 
Supertransaction.

```ts [Execute Supertransaction]
const { hash } = await meeClient.executeQuote({
  quote
})
```

#### Get a Tracking Link for the MEE Explorer

You can track the execution of the Supertransaction by 
visiting the [MEE Explorer](https://meescan.biconomy.io)

```ts [Tracking Link]
console.log("Link: ", getMeeScanLink(hash))
```

#### Wait for the Supertransaction to Execute

```ts
// Wait for the MEE Node to commit the transactions
// within the Supertransaction onchain
const receipt = await meeClient.waitForSupertransactionReceipt({
  hash
})
```
::::

## Concise Implementation
The previous implementation went step by step. Now we 
will show the concise implementation of this exact same 
execution.

```ts [Concise Implementation]
const meeClient = await createMeeClient({
  account: await toMultichainNexusAccount({
    chains: [optimism, base, polygon, arbitrum],
    transports: [http(), http(), http(), http()],
    signer: eoaSigner
  })
})

const { hash } = await meeClient.executeQuote({
  quote: await meeClient.getQuote({
    instructions: [
      mcNexus.build({ type: "default", data: { chainId: optimism.id, calls: [{ to: zeroAddress, value: 0n }] } }),
    ],
    feeToken: {
      chainId: optimism.id,
      address: mcUSDC.addressOn(optimism.id)
    }
  })
})

const receipt = await meeClient.waitForSupertransactionReceipt({
  hash
})
```
