# ðŸ“ƒ Supported Gas Tokens

The Biconomy MEE uses a solver based approch for accepting gas tokens. If our solvers know how 
to convert your token into `ETH` or `USDC` - we can accept the token as gas.

This means you can use tokens such as AAVE/Venus/Morpho Position tokens (e.g. `aUSDC`, `vUSDT`, ...), 
you can use Uniswap LP position tokens, staked tokens, governance tokens, etc...

This means that - for most cases - you can just deduct the token which is actually being
used for the transcation to pay for some of the gas. 

Beyond this - gas abstraction and gas sponosorship are multi-chain so you can use 
any of the thousands of gas tokens on any of the supported chains to pay for execution
of a transaction on any other supported chain.
