# Instruction Builders Overview

The orchestration in the Biconomy stack is done by orchestrating a series of
`Instruction` objects. Every instruction object is a `{ to, value, data }` tuple
which will make an onchain function call.

You can encode these Instructions manually, but in order to simplify creating
common Instructions, we've exposed several instruction builders.

The instruction builder is created by creating the multichain Nexus 
account instance:

```ts
const oNexus = await toMultichainNexusAccount({
  chains: [optimism, base],
  transports: [http(), http()],
  signer: privateKeyToAccount('0xSigner')
})
```

Then you will have the `.build` method exposed on this account instance:

```ts
const instruction = await oNexus.build({
  type: '' // The type of helper you're using
  data: {} // Type safe data for that type of helper
})
```
