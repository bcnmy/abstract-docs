# üóùÔ∏è¬†What Are Smart Sessions?

Smart Sessions are a powerful feature of the Biconomy stack which allows accounts (EOAs and Smart Accounts) to delegate
certain permissions to other signers. These permissions are delegated with certain conditions attached (e.g. how much
funds the new signer can use, which contracts and functions they can call or _when_ they can exeucute).

Smart Sessions are extremely useful for **automation** and **agentic execution**.

## üëÅÔ∏è Example

Imagine an agent which rebalances the user funds across chains into the highest yielding USDC oportunity across
blue chip lending and yield farming protocols. We can set up a multichain Smart Session like this:

1. The agent is only allowed to call Morpho, Venus, AAVE and Yearn contracts on Optimism, Base, Ethereum Mainnet and Polygon.
2. The agent is only allowed to spend USDC
3. The maximum amount the agent can spend is 10,000.00 USDC

As a developer, you would:

:::steps
##### Create a private key for the agent signer

##### Request for the user to sign a transaction which installs the Smart Sessions module (gasless)

##### Request the user to sign the specific permissions being given

##### Sign transactions on the users behalf (e.g. move the position from AAVE on OP to Morpho on Base)
::::

This would be two signatures for the user (one to install the module, one to approve the permissions) and both 
would be fully gasless.

## üß° Choose Biconomy for Smart Sessions

### ‚ÜîÔ∏è Biconomy Smart Sessions are Multichain

Unlike ERC-4337 account providers, the Biconomy Smart Session stack has been built
from the ground up to be multichain first! It supports:

- Installing sessions on multiple chains with a single signature
- Orchestrating multiple function calls across multiple chains with a 
single signature from the session signer
- Permitting complex sessions which span various types of permissions across multiple
chains with a single signature from the user

:::info[Powered by MEE]
The instructions for sessions are executed by the Modular Execution Environment ([learn more](/new/learn-about-biconomy/what-is-mee))
and have full support for our innovative multichain orchestration ([learn more here](/new/learn-about-biconomy/understanding-composable-orchestration))

### üîê Biconomy Smart Sessions work with EOAs

Until now, Smart Sessions were limited to working with Smart Accounts only. This is due 
to the fact that EOAs couldn't approve permissions. However, with the combination
EIP-7702 coming to market and Biconomy publishing our innovative Fusion Execution stack,
the smart sessions offered by Biconomy can work _directly_ from EOAs.
