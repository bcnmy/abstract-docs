# AbstractJS SDK

```bash [Install AbstractJS]
npm install @biconomy/abstractjs viem @rhinestone/module-sdk@0.2.7
```

### Single and Multichain Capabilities
AbstractJS is a comprehensive smart account SDK that goes beyond standard account management capabilities. While it 
provides all the features you'd expect from a smart account SDK - executing UserOps, gas management, signature handling, installing account modules - it's
been supercharged with powerful utilities for multi-chain development.

### Support for both EOAs and Smart Accounts
Additionally, what sets AbstractJS apart is its support for both smart accounts and EOAs. Through our [Fusion module](/mee/fusion), 
EOA users can batch execute operations across multiple chains with a single signature. 

For wallet developers, AbstractJS enables EIP7702, enabling seamless migration of users from EOAs to smart contract accounts while maintaining support for both our innovative Modular Execution Environment (MEE) and traditional Bundler/Paymaster execution paths.

## Work with Chains, Intents and Bridges
Working with multiple chains, bridges, and intents has traditionally required complex infrastructure and significant development effort. AbstractJS eliminates this complexity by providing advanced tools that make multi-chain operations as simple as single-chain ones. Through our innovative MEE infrastructure, developers can orchestrate complex cross-chain transactions and intents with unprecedented ease.

## Open-Source, Built on `viem`
AbstractJS is vendor-neutral, open source and built on the industry-leading `viem` SDK 

:::info[Key Benefits]
- Multi-chain environment support out of the box
- Infrastructure and account neutral design
- Open-source (MIT licensed)
- Built on industry-standard viem SDK
:::

:::tip[Vendor Neutral Design]
AbstractJS works with any ERC4337-compliant smart account including:
- Biconomy Nexus
- Safe
- Kernel
- Other compliant implementations

## Execution Environment Support
AbstractJS supports two distinct execution environments. [Learn more about execution environments](/explained/exec-environments)

::::steps
#### **Modular Execution Environment (MEE)**
A novel execution environment, serving as an evolution to Bundlers and Paymasters, enabling 
execution of transactions and intents and the orchestration of complex multi-chain sequences.

[Learn more about MEEs](/explained/mee)
   
#### **ERC4337 Bundler & Paymaster Execution Environment**
Industry standard and battle tested execution stack. Enables developers to sponsor transactions for users,
users to pay for transactions with ERC20 tokens and batch executions.

## Advanced Smart Account & Module Support
AbstractJS enables developers to create smart accounts, connect them to execution environments, install account
modules (like Passkeys, Session Keys, MultiSigs, Account Recover and more...), encode and execute UserOps and 
Supertransactions through Smart Accounts and use Smart Accounts with EOA users.

## Multi-Chain Smart Account Management
AbstractJS streamlines the complexity of working with smart accounts across multiple chains. You can deploy and manage accounts across networks like Polygon, Optimism, and Base with unified interfaces and consistent APIs.

```ts [Code Example: Using a Biconomy Nexus Account on Multiple Chains]
const mcNexus = await toMultichainNexusAccount({
  signer: eoa,
  chains: [optimism, base, polygon, arbitrum],
  transports: [http(), http(), http(), http()]
})
```

## EOA Multi-Chain Batch Execution (Fusion)
The Fusion feature provides advanced capabilities for EOA accounts:
- Execute multiple transactions across chains with one signature
- Pay gas fees on a single chain
- Automated cross-chain execution sequencing

## Multi-Chain Utilities

AbstractJS provides essential tools for multi-chain development:

::::steps
#### **Contract Management Across Chains**
Map multiple contract instances across multiple chains into a single object. Use it to
effortlessly encode UserOps across on all chains.

#### **Unified Multichain Balance**
All utility functions within AbstractJS can work with a Unified Multichain Balance
object - which treats all balances across all chains - as if it was a single one.

#### **Bridge & Intent Integration**
Find optimal bridging routes and combine multiple intent providers in just a few lines of code. Modern
onchain environments require a lot of moving funds across chains - AbstractJS makes this effortless for 
the developer and invisible for the user.

## Transaction Orchestration
AbstractJS enables complex transaction sequences across multiple chains. You can build operations that:
- Move tokens between chains
- Interact with DeFi protocols
- Manage approvals and permissions
- Execute multi-step operations atomically
