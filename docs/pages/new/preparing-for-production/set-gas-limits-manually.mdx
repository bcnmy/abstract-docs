# ⚙️ Setting Manual Gas Limits

AbstractJS assigns **generous default gas limits** to every instruction so you can prototype quickly without tweaking `gasLimit` values. Once you move to production, those defaults become sub‑optimal—quotes may look expensive and confuse users.

## 🤔 Why you should care

| 🔢 Stage             | 🤝 Default behaviour                             | ✅ Impact                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **PoC / testing** | High gas limits keep dev friction near‑zero   | Faster iterations                              |
| **Production**    | High limits over‑inflate the **quoted price** | Users see a larger “max cost” and may drop off |

### 🧾 Quote vs. Actual Cost

* The price returned by `meeClient.getQuote()` is a **maximum**. <br />If you overshoot, MEE refunds all unspent gas to the user **on‑chain**.
* Lowering `gasLimit` keeps the quote realistic and improves conversion, without risking “out of gas” as long as you size it sensibly.

## ✍️ How to set manual limits

Add a `gasLimit` field (in wei) to each instruction’s `data` object:

```ts
const instruction = await orchestrator.buildComposable({
  type: "default",
  data: {
    abi: erc20Abi,
    to: "0xUSDC_ADDRESS",
    chainId: optimism.id,
    functionName: "transfer",
    args: [
      "0xRecipient",
      parseUnits("10", 6),
    ],
    gasLimit: 35_000n, // manual limit
  },
});
```

### ⚙️ Recommended workflow

1. **Start high**, observe gas used in testnet.
2. **Trim** the limit to \~20 % above observed usage.
3. **Ship** with explicit limits so quotes stay tight.

## Takeaways

* High defaults are fine for dev, but tune gas limits before mainnet launch.
* Quotes show *max* cost; unused gas is always refunded.
* Clear, lower quotes reduce sticker shock and user drop‑off.
