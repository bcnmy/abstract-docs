# EIP-7702 Gas Abstracted Transactions with Privy and Biconomy

In this guide, we demonstrate using Biconomy's AbstractJS together with Privy to enable your users to send gas abstracted transactions using EIP-7702.
The guide demonstrates how to allow users to pay for their gas with USDC.

One of the core features of the Biconomy stack is the ability to accept thousands of ERC-20 tokens across dozens of 
chains to pay for gas. However, the true value lies in the ability to combine these gas abstracted experiences with
our powerful Multichain Orchestration stack!

This tutorial will serve as the guide to getting you started on working with the Biconomy stack and Privy. After 
following this tutorial, you can follow our Multichain Orchestration Guides to learn how to execute complex single-chain
and multi-chain actions with a single user signature - while abstracting away all gas.

## 1. Install dependencies

In your app's repository, install the required dependencies from Privy, Biconomy, and viem:

```bash
npm i @privy-io/react-auth @biconomy/abstractjs viem @rhinestone/module-sdk@0.2.7
```

## 2. Configure Privy settings

Configure your app to create embedded wallets for all users when they login:

```jsx
<PrivyProvider
  appId={import.meta.env.VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID}
  config={{
    loginMethods: ["email"],
    embeddedWallets: {
      createOnLogin: true,
      noPromptOnSignature: true
    }
  }}
>
  {children}
</PrivyProvider>
```

## 3. Access Privy's embedded wallet

First, get the user's embedded wallet using Privy's hooks:

```jsx
import { usePrivy, useWallets, useSignAuthorization } from "@privy-io/react-auth";

// Inside your component
const { authenticated } = usePrivy();
const { wallets } = useWallets();
const { signAuthorization } = useSignAuthorization();

// Get the first wallet (embedded wallet)
const embeddedWallet = wallets[0];
```

## 4. Create a viem wallet client with the embedded wallet

Create a viem wallet client for the embedded wallet and set the appropriate chain:

```jsx
import { createWalletClient, custom } from "viem";
import { optimism } from "viem/chains";

// Switch to the chain you want to use
await embeddedWallet.switchChain(optimism.id);

// Get Ethereum provider
const provider = await embeddedWallet.getEthereumProvider();

// Create viem wallet client
const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  account: embeddedWallet.address,
  chain: optimism,
  transport: custom(provider)
});
```

## 5. Sign the EIP-7702 authorization

Use Privy's `signAuthorization` function to generate the required authorization:

```jsx

const nexusImplementationAddress = '0x000000004F43C49e93C970E84001853a70923B03'

// Sign authorization for EIP-7702. When chainId is set to 0
// the authorization is valid for all chains.
const authorization = await signAuthorization({
  contractAddress: nexusImplementationAddress,
  chainId: 0
});

console.log("Authorization signed:", authorization);
```

## 6. Create the EIP-7702 Biconomy account

Create a multichain Nexus account using the signed authorization:

```jsx
import { http } from "viem";
import { optimism, base } from "viem/chains";
import { toMultichainNexusAccount } from "@biconomy/abstractjs";

// Create the multichain Nexus account with EIP-7702
const nexusAccount = await toMultichainNexusAccount({
  // Chains to support
  chains: [optimism, base],
  
  // HTTP providers for each chain
  transports: [http(), http()],
  
  // Use the viem wallet client as signer
  signer: walletClient,
  
  // CRITICAL: Override account address with EOA address for EIP-7702
  accountAddress: embeddedWallet.address
});

console.log("EIP-7702 Smart Account created at:", embeddedWallet.address);
console.log("Same address on Optimism:", nexusAccount.addressOn(optimism.id));
console.log("Same address on Base:", nexusAccount.addressOn(base.id));
```

## 7. Create the MEE client for transaction execution

Create the Multichain Execution Environment (MEE) client for sending transactions:

```jsx
import { createMeeClient } from "@biconomy/abstractjs";

// Create the MEE client
const meeClient = await createMeeClient({
  account: nexusAccount
});

console.log("MEE client created successfully");
```

## 8. Send a gas abstracted transaction

Now you can use the MEE client to send a gas abstracted transaction:

```jsx


// Execute gas abstracted transaction
const { hash } = await meeClient.execute({
  // Include authorization
  authorization: autorization,
  
  // Pay for gas with USDC on Optimism
  feeToken: {
    address: mcUSDC.addressOn(optimism.id) // USDC on Optimism Address
    chainId: optimism.id
  }
  
  // Transaction instructions
  instructions: [{
    chainId: optimism.id,
    calls: [
      {
        to: zeroAddress,
        value: 0n
      }
    ]
  }],

});

console.log("Gas abstracted transaction submitted:", hash);
```

## 9. Wait for transaction receipt

After submitting the transaction, you can wait for its receipt:

```jsx
// Wait for transaction to complete
const receipt = await meeClient.waitForSupertransactionReceipt({ hash });
console.log("Transaction successful:", receipt.transactionHash);
```

## 10. Send a cross-chain gas abstracted transaction

One powerful feature of Biconomy is executing transactions across multiple chains:

```jsx
// Create instructions for different chains
const crossChainInstructions = [
  // Operation on Optimism
  {
    chainId: optimism.id,
    calls: [{ // Dummy calls
      to: zeroAddress,
      value: 0n
    }]
  },
  // Operation on Base
  {
    chainId: base.id,
    calls: [{ // Dummy calls
      to: zeroAddress,
      value: 0n
    }]
  }
];

// Execute gas abstracted cross-chain transaction
const { hash } = await meeClient.execute({
  authorization: txAuthorization,
  delegate: true
  instructions: crossChainInstructions,
});

console.log("Cross-chain transaction submitted:", hash);
```

## 11. Using runtime parameter injection

Biconomy supports dynamic parameters determined at execution time:

```jsx
import { runtimeERC20BalanceOf, greaterThanOrEqualTo } from "@biconomy/abstractjs";

// Create an instruction with runtime value
const runtimeInstruction = await nexusAccount.buildComposable({
  type: "default",
  data: {
    abi: erc20Abi,
    functionName: "transfer",
    chainId: optimism.id,
    to: tokenAddress,
    args: [
      recipientAddress,
      // Use the token balance at execution time
      runtimeERC20BalanceOf({
        targetAddress: nexusAccount.addressOn(optimism.id),
        tokenAddress: tokenAddress,
        constraints: [greaterThanOrEqualTo(minAmount)]
      })
    ]
  }
});
```

## Conclusion

You've now learned how to use Biconomy's AbstractJS with Privy to enable EIP-7702 gas abstracted transactions. This implementation provides:

- Email-based, phone or Passkey login with automatic wallet creation
- EIP-7702 delegation to create Smart Accounts at the same address
- Cross-chain operations with a single signature
- Runtime parameter injection for dynamic transaction values

The key parts of the integration are:
1. Using `signAuthorization` to authorize EIP-7702 delegation
2. Setting `accountAddress` to the EOA address in `toMultichainNexusAccount`
3. Setting `delegate: true` and `authorization` in the `execute` call
