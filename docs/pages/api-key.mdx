# Getting Production API Keys

Developers can use and test the AbstractJS SDK and access the Modular Execution
Environment (the Biconomy Network) without getting an API key. However, using
the infrastructure this way has rate limits applied to it. 

## Going to Production

In order to get higher rate limits, go to 
[Biconomy Dashboard](https://dashboard.biconomy.io) and create a new 
MEE stack project. There you will have an API key which you can add when
initializing the `MeeClient` in AbstractJS.

```ts
const meeClient = await createMeeClient({
  account: oNexus,
  apiKey: 'mee_your_api_key_here'
});
```
