# üíâ Runtime Parameter Injection

Runtime injection gives developers a powerful way to compose transactions when some values ‚Äî like token amounts ‚Äî aren‚Äôt known until execution time. This is a major evolution beyond traditional static batching, where all parameters must be known upfront.

Instead of asking users to guess or estimate how much will arrive after a bridge or swap, AbstractJS lets you define **placeholders** ‚Äî runtime values ‚Äî that get resolved dynamically when the transaction is executed.

## üí° Why It Matters

Traditional transaction batching is rigid:

* You must hardcode every parameter
* You can't adapt to bridges, swaps, or slippage
* You often over- or under-estimate received amounts

With **runtime injection**, orchestration becomes **adaptive**:

* Use actual token balances at the moment of execution
* Protect users with constraints (e.g. slippage limits)
* Compose flows across chains with fewer assumptions

This eliminates entire classes of user experience problems and makes your apps more reliable.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Basic Usage

```ts
import { runtimeERC20BalanceOf } from "@biconomy/abstractjs";
import { balanceNotZeroConstraint } from "../utils/balanceNotZero.util";

const swapInstruction = await oNexus.buildComposable({
  type: "default",
  data: {
    chainId: optimism.id,
    to: "0xProtocolAddress",
    abi: protocolAbi,
    functionName: "swap",
    args: [
      runtimeERC20BalanceOf({
        tokenAddress: "0xTokenAddress",
        targetAddress: nexusAddress,
        constraints: [balanceNotZeroConstraint]
      })
    ]
  }
});
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Runtime Functions

| Function                | Description                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `runtimeERC20BalanceOf` | Inject the ERC20 balance of a target address at runtime |

### `runtimeERC20BalanceOf`

Inject the token balance of an address ‚Äî most often your orchestrator address ‚Äî at the time of execution.

```ts
import { balanceNotZeroConstraint } from "../utils/balanceNotZero.util";

const transferAll = await mcNexus.buildComposable({
  type: "default",
  data: {
    to: tokenContract,
    abi: erc20Abi,
    functionName: "transfer",
    args: [
      recipient,
      runtimeERC20BalanceOf({
        tokenAddress: tokenAddress,
        targetAddress: mcNexus.addressOn(chain.id),
        constraints: [balanceNotZeroConstraint]
      })
    ],
    chainId: chain.id
  }
});
```

## üß± Constraints = Execution Control

Constraints ensure that runtime-injected values meet specific criteria. If constraints are not met, the instruction will not execute.

But even more importantly ‚Äî they determine **when** instructions will execute. This is key for cross-chain orchestration.

### ‚õìÔ∏è Transaction Ordering

When a runtime value is used, the orchestration system will **wait until all constraints are satisfied** before executing. This means constraints enforce dependency:

```ts
await oNexus.buildComposable({
  chainId: optimism.id,
  args: [
    runtimeERC20BalanceOf({
      tokenAddress: usdcOnOptimism,
      targetAddress: nexusAddress,
      constraints: [balanceNotZeroConstraint]
    })
  ]
});
```

This instruction won‚Äôt execute until `nexusAddress` has a non-zero balance of USDC.

In multi-chain orchestration, this is the mechanism that controls execution sequencing.

### üí∏ Handling Slippage

```ts
constraints: [
  greaterThanOrEqualTo((expectedAmount * 90n) / 100n)
]
```

Use constraints to ensure execution only proceeds under acceptable conditions.

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety Nets

Constraints act like assert statements. If the value isn't good ‚Äî don‚Äôt execute.

## üåâ Cross-Chain Example

```ts
import { balanceNotZeroConstraint } from "../utils/balanceNotZero.util";

// Step 1: Bridge
const bridgeInstruction = await oNexus.buildComposable({
  // bridging config
});

// Step 2: Wait for funds, then swap
const swapInstruction = await oNexus.buildComposable({
  type: "default",
  data: {
    chainId: optimism.id,
    to: "0xSwapProtocol",
    abi: swapAbi,
    functionName: "swapExactTokensForTokens",
    args: [
      runtimeERC20BalanceOf({
        tokenAddress: usdcOnOptimism,
        targetAddress: nexusAddress,
        constraints: [balanceNotZeroConstraint]
      })
    ]
  }
});
```

**How this works:**

1. MEE simulates the swap instruction
2. Simulation fails (no tokens yet)
3. MEE waits and retries
4. Bridge completes
5. Constraints satisfied ‚Üí transaction proceeds


## ‚úÖ Best Practices

* ‚úÖ Use runtime injection when values are unknown ahead of time
* ‚úÖ Always apply constraints to protect users and define execution rules
* ‚úÖ Use with transfer instructions to sweep remaining balances
* ‚úÖ Design for graceful failure if constraints aren't met


## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

AbstractJS builds orchestration callData with **placeholders**. During execution:

1. The smart account receives `executeComposable()`
2. The fallback handler reads blockchain state
3. Runtime values are injected into calldata
4. The final transaction executes with those resolved parameters

This eliminates the need for custom smart contracts or multi-step user flows.

## üß† Summary

Runtime injection turns your orchestration flows into **state-aware, auto-sequencing logic** that adapts to bridge results, swap outputs, slippage conditions, and more.

Use it when:

* You‚Äôre building cross-chain workflows
* You can‚Äôt predict output values
* You want fewer failures and better UX
