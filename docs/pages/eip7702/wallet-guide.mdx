# For dApps using Embedded Wallets

If you are using an embedded wallet provider (e.g. Privy, Dynamic, Web3Auth, Magic, ...) 
you're able to *delegate* your EOA to a Biconomy Smart Account (this is not possible with 
external wallets such as MetaMask, Rabby, etc... - for those, use [Companion Account](/smarteoa/companion-explained) based execution)

## Why EIP-7702
EIP-7702 is an upcoming upgrade to Ethereum and EVM blockchains which enables
wallets to convert the user EOA wallets into Smart Accounts

With EIP-7702, wallets can drastically improve the UX for their users by offering smart
account features, such as:


* **Gas Abstraction** <br/>
The ability to pay for gas with ERC20 tokens <br/> <br/>


* **Gas Sponsorship** <br/>
Wallets can sponsor user gas onchain and offer their users a different way of paying for their
transactions (e.g. prepaid, postpaid, ...) <br/> <br/>


* **Batch Execution** <br/>
The ability to batch execute transactions with a single signature <br/> <br/>


* **Enable Automation** <br/>
Wallets can install (or enable apps to install) Session Keys on accounts, which provide a
safe way to automate wallet actions. Session keys provide guardrails, meaning that the Session Key
signer can only execute the exact transactions approved by the wallet/user. This can include enabling
dollar cost averaging, TWAP selling, yield rebalancing, ... <br/> <br/>


## The Most Comprehensive EIP-7702 Solutions Suite

At Biconomy, we have built the most comprehensive EIP-7702 solution on the market, enabling
wallets to add all of the above mentioned features, as well as many advanced - Biconomy 
stack specific features:

* **Unified User Balances** <br/>
Wallets can present apps with a _Unified Multichain Balance_. The app can then "pull" the 
funds they need to the chain of their choosing. Wallets can work with solvers and bridges
to provide this liquidity. <br/> <br/>

* **Cross-Chain Gas Abstraction** <br/>
Wallets can enable users to pay for gas with native or ERC20 tokens across chains. E.g. a
user can pay for a transaction on Base with USDC or ETH on Arbitrum. <br/> <br/>


* **Native Scheduling and Automation** <br/>
The Biconomy MEE Nodes can commit to execute a transaction at some point in the future or to
execute a series of transactions in some time period. For Biconomy integrators, this is available
without installing a separate module. <br/> <br/>

## Quickstart Guide for Developers

::::steps
#### Install Packages
Install `AbstractJS` TypeScript SDK and viem 

```bash
npm install @biconomy/abstractjs viem @rhinestone/module-sdk@0.2.7
```

#### Override the Smart Account Address

In order to create an EIP-7702 enabled wallet, you need to implement just one small change to the initialization 
process. When initializing your Nexus account instance, you need to _override_ the `accountAddress` paramter to the 
address of your embbeded wallet EOA.

```ts
// Function which initializes your embedded wallets. For this, check the tutorials
// from the embedded wallet providers themselves. This function should result in a
// signer object.
const embeddedWalletEOA = initializeEmbeddedWallet()

// The multichain Nexus account 
const mcNexus = await toMultichainNexusAccount({

  // Make sure that the chains here are actually EIP-7702 enabled
  chains: [sepolia],
  transports: [http(), http(), http()],
  signer: embeddedWalletEOA,

  // Overriding the account address parameter here! You *must* set
  // this paramter to the EOA address in order to enable EIP-7702
  accountAddress: embeddedWalletEOA.address
}) 
```

:::info
To check which chains have EIP-7702 enabled, check our information on 
[Supported Networks](/supportedNetworks)
:::

#### Execute with MEE

After you have delegated your EOA to a Nexus Account with the EIP-7702 delegation, you're able to use
the full feature-set of Multichain Orchestration, Smart Sessions and Gas Abstraction APIs. The only difference
from the regular execution flow is that you have to set the `delegate` field to `true`!

:::info
Delegations are set just-in-time, which means that they're sent with the first useful transaction! The Biconomy
stack signs delegations with `chainId` paramter set to `0` - which means they can get replayed on all chains.
:::

```ts
const eip7702TxResult = await meeClient.execute({
  feeToken: {
    chainId: sepolia.id, // Pay for gas on Sepolia
    address: zeroAddress // Native token (ETH)
  },
  instructions: [ ], // Supertransaction instructions

  // This enables the EIP-7702 Flow
  delegate: true
})
```
::::

From this guide you can see that adding EIP-7702 to your flows is as easy as overriding 
two properties in the standard MEE execution flow.
