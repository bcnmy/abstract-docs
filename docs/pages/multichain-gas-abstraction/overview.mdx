# Multichain Gas Abstraction

The Biconomy stack has two main ways to abstract away gas complexity from users:

- Enabling users to pay for gas with ERC-20 tokens (e.g. USDC, WETH, ...)
- Enabling apps to sponsor gas for users 

Both of these methods are _natively multichain_

## Multichain ERC-20 Gas Payments 

This method enables the user to pay for gas on one chain, with ERC-20 tokens from any 
chain.

:::tip[Example] 
The User pays for the execution of a transaction on Base, with USDC on Optimism
:::

```ts
const receipt = await meeClient.execute({
  feeToken: {
    address: '0xUSDC',
    chainId: optimism.id
  },
  instructions: [
    {
      chainId: base.id,
      // Empty demo transaction, sending 
      // 0 ETH to 0x000... on Base
      calls: [{
        to: zeroAddress,
        value: 0n
      }]
    }
  ]
})
```

:::info[Native Token]
If you want to use the native token (e.g. ETH) on one chain to pay for the execution
of another chain, you can set the `feeToken.address` to `0x000...`.
