# Use EOAs Like Smart Accounts

Biconomy has developed a unique solution on the market enabling developers
to **batch execute transactions**, execute **cross-chain transactions** and **trigger intents**
for users with EOAs **without upgrading them to smart wallets**

This feature is available for regular users with EOA wallets (such as MetaMask) - without any
protocol upgrades and without moving users to Smart Accounts. Instant onboarding, zero compromises.

:::info[Fusion and EIP7702]
Fusion Module is **100%** compatible with EIP7702 accounts. In fact, we recommend using the Fusion Module
as the ideal solution for apps interacting with both regular and EIP7702 enabled EOAs!

---

Since *only wallets* will be able to upgrade users to EIP7702 accounts, the developers will be limited by the 
features provided by the wallets. These will primarily include gasless execution and batch transactions. Additionally - Most
apps will have a blend of users with and without EIP7702 enabled wallets. 

The `executeFusionTransaction` function in the `AbstractJS` SDK will be able to intelligently switch between using
EIP7702 execution and regular EOA execution. This means that apps using the Fusion module will get:

- Same codebase for both EIP7702 enabled and regular EOA users!
- Additional features offered by Smart Accounts (cross-chain gas sharing, smart sessions, resource locks, ...)

## Single Signature Approve + Execute for EOAs
One of the biggest pain points of using EOAs is the requirement to sign two separate transactions `approve` and `execute`, 
when interacting with a smart contract. Here, we will demonstrate how to supply to AAVE - a transaction which would
usually require two signatures - with just one signature from the user:

::::steps
#### Define an Amount to be Used by the Fusion Transaction

Every Fusion Transaction has an exact amount of some `ERC20` token that it will use. This is usually the amount
that you want to do an action with. In this example, this amount will be the amount that we want to supply to 
AAVE

```ts
const amountToSupply = parseUnits('100', 6) // 100 USDC
```

#### Encode an Approve Call
We will use the `MultichainSmartContract` utilities in `AbstractJS` to encode
an approval for AAVE v3 Pool on Optimism to spend the users USDC

```ts [Encode ERC20 Approve Call]
const approve = mcUSDC.on(optimism.id).approve({
  args: [
    mcAaveV3Pool.addressOn(optimism.id), // approve to aave v3 pool contract
    amountToSupply // amount approved
  ]
}),
```

#### Encode a Supply Call
We'll use the same utilities to encode a supply call to the
AAVE v3 Contract

```ts [Encode a Supply Call]
const supply = mcAaveV3Pool.on(optimism.id).supply({
  args: [
    mcUSDC.addressOn(optimism.id), // asset to supply
    amountToSupply, // amount being supplied,
    mcNexus.signer.address, // beneficiary - our EOA address
    0 // referral code
  ]
})
```

### Encode a Trigger Transaction
The trigger transaction is a transaction which will be posted onchain and
which will trigger the full execution of the Fusion transaction. In most
cases, including this tutorial, this will be a transfer of ERC20 tokens 
to a Smart Contract Account address:

#### Encode a Fusion Transaction
Now, we will use the `AbstractJS` utilities to encode a Fusion Transaction

```ts
const { hash } = await meeClient.executeFusionQuote({
  fusionQuote: await meeClient.getFusionQuote({
    trigger: {
      chainId: optimism.id,
      tokenAddress: mcUSDC.addressOn(optimism.id),
      amount: parseUnits("1", 6)
    },
    instructions: [approve, supply],
    feeToken: {
      address: mcUSDC.addressOn(optimism.id),
      chainId: optimism.id
    }
  })
})
```

#### Track the Transaction!

That's it - your single signature, multi-step transaction has been executed! Without needing
to move users to Smart Accounts.

You can track the execution of the trigger transaction by tracking the `hash` on an EVM explorer.
To track the execution of the additional instructions - you can use the [Biconomy MEE Explorer](https://meescan.biconomy.io)

## Advanced: How Does the Fusion Module Work?

![Fusion Flow](https://i.imgur.com/dVUmznn.png)
Fusion transactions work by employing a Companion Smart Account. This account is invisible to the user
and is used by the Biconomy MEE Node] to execute an arbitrary number of transactions, intents and
cross-chain operations. 

It achieves this by employing the _Fusion Packing Scheme_ which puts the hash of additional instructions 
to be executed _after_ the regular `callData` in an EVM transaction. This extra `callData` is ignored by the 
contract and the EVM transaction is executed normally. 

This first operation in a Fusion transaction is usually a simple `transfer` function which transfers the necessary
amount of an `ERC20` token to the Companion Account. When the user signs this transaction they are also signing the
hash which was appended after the regular `callData`. AbstractJS then sends all of the 
instructions which need to be executed on the Companion account to the The Biconomy [MEE Node](/explained/mee). 

After the `ERC20` token arrives to the Companion account, The MEE Node then calls the `execute` function
on the Companion smart account to execute additional instructions. The Companion account will not allow any 
transactions to be executed which were not _explicitly_ contained in the hash which was appended after the `callData`

In order to be able to execute those transactions, the `MEE Node` provides the full signed transaction 
(called the trigger transaction) as the signature to the Companion smart account.
