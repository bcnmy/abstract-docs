# Understanding the Smart EOA Stack

Let's dive into how Biconomy transforms regular EOA wallets into powerful smart account-like instruments. At its heart, the Smart EOA Stack solves a crucial problem in web3: how to give EOA users advanced features without requiring them to change their wallets or migrate to new accounts.

## The Two Paths to Smart EOAs

Biconomy has developed two distinct approaches to enhance EOA capabilities, each serving different needs while maintaining security and user experience.

## The Fusion Module: Instant Smart Account Features

Think of the Fusion Module as a bridge between the simplicity of EOAs and the power of smart accounts. When your users initiate a transaction through Fusion, 
the MEE stack does work behind the scenes to make sure multiple instructions can be executed with a single signature.

Instead of requiring users to upgrade their wallets or move to new accounts, Fusion employs an innovative "Companion Smart Account" architecture. When users sign a transaction, they're actually signing two things: the standard transaction data and a cryptographically secured set of additional instructions.

This dual-signature approach is what makes Fusion special - it enables features like:
- Executing multiple transactions with a single signature
- Moving assets across chains seamlessly
- Triggering complex intent-based operations
- Batching multiple operations together

Most importantly, all of this happens without users ever needing to know about the underlying complexity. To them, it's just another transaction signature.

## EIP7702: The Future of EOA Evolution

While Fusion provides immediate smart account features, EIP7702 represents the future of EOA enhancement. This upcoming Ethereum standard enables wallets to natively upgrade EOAs to smart accounts, providing a foundation for permanent account enhancement.

Think of EIP7702 as a transformation protocol. When a wallet implements EIP7702, they can offer their users:
- Native gas abstraction capabilities
- Built-in transaction sponsorship
- Seamless batch execution
- Automation through session keys
- Cross-chain balance unification
- Gas payment flexibility across chains

The beauty of EIP7702 lies in its elegance - no new contracts need to be deployed. Instead, it uses a singleton smart account implementation, making the upgrade both gas-efficient and secure.

## Working Together: The Power of Both Solutions

What makes Biconomy's approach unique is that these solutions aren't mutually exclusive. Developers can implement both:
- Use Fusion for immediate smart account features
- Prepare for EIP7702 adoption as wallets implement it

This dual-implementation strategy ensures applications can serve both current needs and future possibilities. Users with traditional EOAs get advanced features through Fusion, while those with EIP7702-enabled wallets get native smart account capabilities.

## The Development Experience

Biconomy has abstracted all this complexity into AbstractJS, making implementation straightforward for developers. Whether you're using Fusion or EIP7702, the SDK provides a clean, consistent interface for accessing these features.

For instance, implementing Fusion features is as simple as creating an MEE client and executing a quote:

```typescript

const { hash } = await meeClient.executeFusionQuote({
  fusionQuote: {
    trigger: {
      chainId: optimism.id,
      tokenAddress: mcUSDC.addressOn(optimism.id),
      amount: amountToSupply
      },
      instructions: [
        mcNexus.build({ ... }),
        mcNexus.build({ ... }),
      ],
    feeToken: {
      address: mcUSDC.addressOn(optimism.id),
      chainId: optimism.id
    }
  }
});
```

## Looking Forward

The Smart EOA Stack represents a crucial evolution in blockchain interaction. By providing both immediate solutions through Fusion and future-proof implementations through EIP7702, Biconomy ensures that applications can offer advanced features to all users, regardless of their wallet type or technical understanding.

This approach embodies a core principle: enhancing blockchain capabilities shouldn't require users to change their existing setups or learn new concepts. Whether through the immediacy of Fusion or the native integration of EIP7702, the Smart EOA Stack makes advanced blockchain features accessible to everyone.
