# Orchestrating with EIP-7702 Delegated EOAs

[EIP-7702](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7702.md) 
enables developers to set smart account code to their EOA address. 

This means that apps can set the Orchestrator smart account to their EOA address
and get the best of both [EOA Orchestration]() and [Smart Account Orchestration]()

### Key Benefits
The key benefits of EIP-7702 powered Orchestration:

- Users don't have to deposit funds to a new Smart Account (no onboarding friction)
- Users get all the benefits of smart account based orchestration such as:
  - Chain Abstraction
  - Unified Token Balances
  - Multi-Chain Gas

### Key Drawbacks
The key drawback of the EIP-7702 orchestration is that it's not available for any
users using extension/external wallets. These wallets (such as MetaMask, 
Rabby, Trust, ...) don't allow for EIP-7702 delegations to be set to EOAs
under their control. The EIP-7702 delegation is set by signing and posting 
a Type 4 EVM transaction, which these wallets will reject. 

## Who Can Leverage EIP-7702 Orchestration?
EIP-7702 orchestration is availbale to apps building on Embedded wallets such
as Privy, Dynamic, etc... Since embedded wallets will allow the app to delegate
the EOA to the orchestrator smart account, apps can easily leverage this 
functionality.

## Using EIP-7702 Orchestration

Leveraging EIP-7702 orchestration is done in two steps:

:::steps
### Delegate
Sign an authorization message which will set the Nexus smart account
code to your wallet.

To learn how to do this, read our [Setting EIP-7702 Delegations]() guide.

### Execute
Afer the EIP-7702 delegation has been set, you can use the same orchestration
as you would for smart accounts, with the only difference beign that you'd 
need to override the `accountAddress` parameter when initializing the 
account. 


```ts
// Override the accountAddress parameter to be the same
// as your EOA address.
const oNexus = await toMultichainNexusAccount({
    signer: eoa,
    accountAddress: eoa.address,
    chains: [optimism, polygon, base]
})
```
