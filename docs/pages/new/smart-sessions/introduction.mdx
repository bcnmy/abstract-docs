# 🗝️ What Are Smart Sessions?

Smart Sessions let a **user‑owned Smart Account (SCA)** delegate *limited* control to a 
secondary signer (the **Session Signer**). 

Think of them as programmable “power‑of‑attorney” rules:

| Aspect       | Example                       | Why It Matters                    |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Who**      | Session Signer address        | Only that key can act.            |
| **When**     | Until  OR every Monday 2‑5 PM | Prevents unlimited‑lifetime keys. |
| **How much** | ≤ 100 USDC total              | Caps risk.                        |
| **What**     | Only swap on Uniswap V3       | Blocks malicious calls.           |

## Biconomy Smart Sessions are Multichain

Unlike ERC-4337 account providers, the Biconomy Smart Session stack has been built
from the ground up to be multichain first! It supports:

- Installing sessions on multiple chains with a single signature
- Orchestrating multiple function calls across multiple chains with a 
single signature from the session signer
- Permitting complex sessions which span various types of permissions across multiple
chains with a single signature from the user

:::info[Powered by MEE]
The instructions for sessions are executed by the Modular Execution Environment ([learn more](/new/learn-about-biconomy/what-is-mee))
and have full support for our innovative multichain orchestration ([learn more here](/new/learn-about-biconomy/understanding-composable-orchestration))

## Biconomy Smart Sessions work with EOAs

Until now, Smart Sessions were limited to working with Smart Accounts only. This is due 
to the fact that EOAs couldn't approve permissions. However, with the combination
EIP-7702 coming to market and Biconomy publishing our innovative Fusion Execution stack,
the smart sessions offered by Biconomy can work _directly_ from EOAs.
