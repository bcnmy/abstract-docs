# üß° Fusion Mode Orchestration (External Wallets)

External wallets, such as MetaMask or Rabby, do not permit direct installation of smart account logic on EOAs. To enable MEE orchestration in this case, **Fusion Mode** is used. It relies on a passthrough mechanism involving a Companion smart account and a signed **trigger transaction**.

#### We recomment understanding Fusion Execution before executing code, but if you'd like to skip the theory - [read the code guide](/new/getting-started/pay-gas-erc20-token#-2-fusion-mode-used-with-external-wallets)

## üé¥ Fusion Mode Flow:

:::steps
#### **Trigger Signature** 
   The user signs a *trigger transaction* that includes the hash of all orchestration instructions. This signature authorizes the full orchestration with a single user action.

#### **Funds Transferred to Companion Account** 
   Funds are temporarily pulled into a *Companion Account* fully owned by the user. This account is non-custodial and stateless‚Äîno funds are stored there beyond execution.

#### **Instruction Execution** 
   All instructions (e.g., swaps, bridges, multicalls) are executed using the Companion Account.

#### **Return to EOA** 
   Resulting assets are sent back to the user's EOA. The Companion Account is left clean with no dust.

#### **Optional Cleanup** 
   If an orchestration step fails‚Äîespecially in multichain setups‚Äîa cleanup can revert intermediate steps, returning funds or rebalancing tokens.

Fusion Mode allows orchestrated execution even without embedded wallet features, enabling advanced UX with any external wallet.


## üé¨ Trigger Types

There are two kinds of Fusion triggers. They depend on which type of token you are using as 
the input token. 

If you're working with tokens which support `ERC20Permit` then you can use the `ERC20Permit`
trigger type, which makes the entire orchestration gasless. Otherwise, you must use the 
`Onchain Tx` trigger, which requires a bit of gas on source chain to execute the `approve` ERC20
transaction. 

| Trigger Type     | How it Works                                                        | Gas Required | Token Support        |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **ERC20Permit**  | Uses ERC-2612 signature to permit spending. Orchestration hash is packed into the `deadline` field. | ‚ùå No         | Only ERC-2612 tokens |
| **Onchain Tx**   | Any EVM transaction that includes orchestration instructions. Most often an `approve()` call.          | ‚úÖ Yes        | All token types      |

The SDK will detect whether a token supports ERC-2612 and choose the appropriate trigger type.

## ‚ôæÔ∏è Fusion Constraints
- Can **only consume one token per user signature**.
- Token used for execution must also be used to pay for gas.
- **Transaction sponsorship** is possible and bypasses the gas requirement.

## üî¢ Fusion Flow
1. **Trigger**: User signs a transaction (e.g. `approve`) that signals orchestration.
2. **Orchestrate**: MEE nodes execute function calls, bridges, or other logic.
3. **Return**: Final steps return assets to the user‚Äôs EOA.

:::info[Stateless UX]
Users never need to know about the orchestrator account. All resulting tokens return to the user‚Äôs EOA automatically.
