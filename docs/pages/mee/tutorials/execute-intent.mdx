# Execute an Intent

## About Intents 

`AbstractJS` enables developers to provide extremely quick chain 
abstracted experiences to their users by leveraging industry-leading
intent solvers.

By encoding an intent into a Supertransaction, developers can 
move funds from one chain to another in record times (even under
a second), without the user ever needing to see the "bridging"
operation. `AbstractJS` is able to execute multiple intents, moving
funds from multiple chains, in a single operation.

## Open, Secure and liquid

:::tip
### No vendor lock-in
Biconomy Modular Execution Environment
leverages a vendor-neutral intent model, meaning that developers can 
choose which provider they're working with. `AbstractJS` comes built-in
with plugins for triggering the biggest intent providers, giving 
our users best execution prices and the fastest execution speed.
:::


:::tip
### Mix-and-match intent providers
AbstractJS enables developers to mix-and-match multiple intent
providers to get the best execution price. 

--- 

For example,
an optimal route to get 1000 USDC on Optimism might include 
moving 600 USDC from Base using Across and moving 400 USDC
from Polygon using debridge. AbstractJS can encode both of those providers into a single 
Supertransaction and trigger both of them within a single
user action.
:::

:::tip
### Use battle-tested, liquid protocols
Whether you need to clear $1 or $1M - `AbstractJS` will find the 
optimal route for you. Our utility functions quote the most liquid,
secure and battle tested solutions on the market.

## Guide

Using Intents in `AbstractJS` is extremely easy, as it comes with 
utility functions which enable developers to encode intents in just
a few lines of code.

This guide will explore a case where the developer will use 
intent based execution to:

- Move USDC to Optimism
- Supply the received amount to AAVE

For the purposes of this guide, we'll assume that the user 
doesn't have any funds on Optimism. 

::::steps
#### Install AbstractJS and viem

```bash [Install AbstractJS]
npm install @biconomy/abstractjs viem @rhinestone/module-sdk
```

#### Initialize the infrastructure
In execute intents, users need to initialize the [`MultichainSmartAccount`](/mee/tutorials/manage-multichain-sca)
and connect to the Biconomy [MEE Node](/explained/mee). Connecting to the [MEE Node](/explained/mee) is done by creating an 
`meeClient`. To learn more about the setup, read our [Building a Chain Abstracted App](/mee/tutorials/build-chainabstracted-app) guide.

```ts [Connect the infrastructure]
// Initialize the MultichainSmartAccount
const mcNexus = await toMultichainNexusAccount({
  chains: [optimism, base, polygon],
  signer: eoaAccount
})

// Connect to the MEE Node
const meeClient = createMeeClient({
  account: mcNexus
})
```

#### Encode an Intent

To encode an intent, simply call the `buildIntent` function
provided by the SDK. This function will check where your 
user has funds, and encode the optimal set of instructions
to move their funds.

:::tip[Intent not Needed]
If the user has enough funds on the target chain, the `buildIntent`
function will return an empty instruction set.

---

This behaviour means developers don't have to write if/else
statements which check whether or not an intent should be triggered
:::

```ts
const intent = await buildIntent(meeClient, {
  mcToken: mcUSDC,
  amount: parseUnits('100', 6),
  chain: optimism
})
```

#### Prepare post-intent actions

Often times, after an intent has been executed - the user wants to 
execute additional actions. For this example, we'll use supplying to 
AAVE as an example.

First, instantiate the AAVE contract. This can be done by using the `AbstractJS`
utility type `MultichainContract` - click here to learn how
`AbstractJS` multichain utilities simplify the modern onchain DevEx 

```ts
const mcAaveV3Pool = getMultichainContract({
  abi: parseAbi([
      "function supply(address asset, uint256 amount, address onBehalfOf, uint16 referralCode)",
  ]),
  deployments: [
      ["0x794a61358D6845594F94dc1DB02A252b5b4814aD", optimism.id],
  ],
});
```

Then, encode the `approve` and `supply` functions to be executed on 
the AAVE contract on Optimism:

```ts
const supplyToAaveOp: Instruction[] = [
  // Approve USDC to AAVE
  mcUSDC.on(optimism.id).approve({
    args: [
      mcUSDC.addressOn(optimism.id),
      parseUnits('99', 6)
    ],
    gasLimit: 100_000n
  }),
  // Call `Supply` on AAVE
  mcAAVE.on(optimism.id).supply({
    args: [
      mcUSDC.addressOn(optimism.id),
      parseUnits('99', 6),
      zeroAddress,
      0
    ],
    gasLimit: 100_000n
  })
]
```

Then, encode a `Supertransaction` containing the instructions from the 
intent and the instructions for supplying to AAVE:

```ts
const superTx: SuperTransaction = {
  instructions: [
    intent,
    ...supplyToAaveOp
  ],
  feeToken: toFeeToken({
    chain: optimism,
    token: mcUSDC
  })
}
```
