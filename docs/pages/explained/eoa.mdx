# EOA Support 
The Biconomy stack offers industry-leading support for giving EOA account smart account features. With support for 
both wallets trying to migrate their users to smart accounts through EIP7702 and for apps looking to provide their 
EOA users with advanced smart account features - the Biconomy stack is the perfect choice for all developers building
for users with EOA accounts.

## Fusion Execution

Biconomy Fusion allows you to encode and execute batch transactions, including multichain batch transactions - with a single
onchain EVM transaction. The Fusion module works by employing the concept of a `Companion` Smart Contract Account assinged 
to every EOA account. The Companion account is used by the MEE to execute an arbitrary number of transactions across
multiple chains. 

In order to enable the execution of the Fusion transaction though the Companion account, the user needs to sign a specially
formatted EVM transaction (encoded by our SDK) and post it onchain. This transaction contains instructions on how much
funds will be consumed by the Fusion transaction as well as all of the instructions that the user wants to execute.


::::steps
#### Transfer funds to Companion Account
The user encodes a Fusion formatted transaction which transfers the amount of funds required for the execution of the 
desired action to the Companion Account address. (e.g. transfer 1000 USDC to Companion account)

#### Execute Transactions
Once the funds arrive to the Companion account, the MEE Node starts executing all required transactions - even across 
multiple chains. (e.g. once 1000 USDC arrive to Companio account - bridge the funds to Base and supply to a lending protocol)

#### Return Funds to EOA
The last action encoded in the instructions can be the transfer of any resulting funds from the Companion account to the 
EOA

#### Single signature execution 

The real magic of the Fusion Module comes from an innovative transaction encoding scheme, all of those transactions to be
executed with a single user signature.

## EIP7702 Support
If you're a wallet looking to integrate EIP7702, read our [Integration Guide](/eip7702/wallet-guide) to get a comprehensive
overview of the steps needed to enable gas abstraction, gas sponsorhips and batch execution for your users.

Our EIP7702 stack uses the advanced Biconomy Modular Execution Environment as the backbone, offering notable benefits 
compared to alternatives using the Bundler/Paymaster stack. 

### Benefits 

- **Multichain gas sponsoships**

  Use a single gas tank to sponsor user transactions across all supported blockchains.

- **Multichain gas abstraction**

  Use native or ERC20 tokens on any chain to pay for transaction execution on any other chain. E.g. pay for 
  a transaction on Optimism with USDC on Arbitrum.

- **Unfied balances**

  Treat user balances across multiple chains as a single balance. When users wish to execute an action on one chain
  the Biconomy MEE infrastructure will enable you to encode a Suprtransaction which pulls their funds from multiple
  blockchains and executes the action on the destination chain - in a single signature.
