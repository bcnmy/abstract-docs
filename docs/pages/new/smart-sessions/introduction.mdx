# 🗝️ What Are Smart Sessions?

Smart Sessions let a **user‑owned Smart Account (SCA)** delegate *limited* control to a 
secondary signer (the **Session Signer**). 

Think of them as programmable “power‑of‑attorney” rules:

| Aspect       | Example                       | Why It Matters                    |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Who**      | Session Signer address        | Only that key can act.            |
| **When**     | Until  OR every Monday 2‑5 PM | Prevents unlimited‑lifetime keys. |
| **How much** | ≤ 100 USDC total              | Caps risk.                        |
| **What**     | Only swap on Uniswap V3       | Blocks malicious calls.           |

## Biconomy Smart Sessions are Multichain

Unlike ERC-4337 account providers, the Biconomy Smart Session stack has been built
from the ground up to be multichain first! It supports:

- Installing sessions on multiple chains with a single signature
- Orchestrating multiple function calls across multiple chains with a 
single signature from the session signer
- Permitting complex sessions which span various types of permissions across multiple
chains with a single signature from the user

The instructions for sessions are executed by the Modular Execution Environment ([learn more](/mee/what-is-mee))
and have full support for our innovative multichain orchestration ([learn more here](/new/learn-about-biconomy/understanding-composable-orchestration))


## Biconomy Smart Sessions work with EOAs

Until now, Smart Sessions were limited to working with Smart Accounts only. This is due 
to the fact that EOAs couldn't approve permissions. However, with the combination
EIP-7702 coming to market and Biconomy publishing our innovative Fusion Execution stack,
the smart sessions offered by Biconomy can work _directly_ from EOAs.

[Learn about EIP-7702](/new/getting-started/enable-mee-eoa-7702) if you want to enable smart sessions for Embedded Wallet
(Privy, Dynamic, Turnkey) users.

[Learn about Fusion Execution](/new/getting-started/enable-mee-eoa-fusion) if you want to enable smart sessions for External 
(MetaMask, Rabby, Trust, ...) users.


## Using Smart Sessions
How are smart sessions activated?

:::steps
#### Deploy Smart Account
You deploy the Nexus smart account on all the chains where you want to use the 
smart sessions

#### Install Sessions Module
Nexus smart account is _modular_ which means you can install custom modules on the 
account which extend its functionality. One of those modules is the smart sessions 
module.

#### Define and Grant Permissions
The developer defines all the permissions which they want the session signer 
to have. The user must sign a payload which will grant those permissions to 
the session signer.

#### Consume Permissions
The session signer can begin consuming permissions.
