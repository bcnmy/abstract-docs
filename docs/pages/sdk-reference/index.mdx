## Bundler Client vs MEE Client

| Feature | MEE Client | 4337 Bundler Client |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|
| Cross-chain execution | ✅ | ❌ |
| Cross-chain gas payment | ✅ | ❌ |
| Transaction orchestration | ✅ | ❌ |
| Runtime composability | ✅ | ❌ |
| Intent-based execution | ✅ | ❌ |
| Support for EOAs | ✅ | ❌ |
| Single-chain gas abstraction | ✅ | ✅ |
| Batched transactions (same chain) | ✅ | ✅ |

### When to Use MEE Client

Choose the MEE Client when:
- Your application spans multiple blockchains
- You need cross-chain orchestration with a single signature
- You want to pay gas fees using tokens from any chain
- You need runtime composability between chains
- You're building complex DeFi workflows that operate across networks

Unlike the traditional ERC-4337 Bundler Client which is limited to single-chain operations, the MEE Client is designed for cross-chain applications. The MEE Client is more complex and depends on the MEE infrastructure for cross-chain coordination.

Choose MEE Client when building applications that:
- Span multiple blockchains
- Require complex transaction sequences
- Need to support both EOA and Smart Account users

### When to Use Bundler Client

Choose the Bundler Client when:
- Your application operates on a single blockchain
- You need standard ERC-4337 account abstraction features
- Performance on a single chain is prioritized
- You need direct control over transaction bundling

The Bundler Client is limited to operations within a single chain - it cannot execute cross-chain transactions or pay for gas using tokens from different chains.
