# üî∂ EIP-7702 Orchestration (Embedded Wallets)

EIP-7702 enables smart account features to be directly installed on an EOA. This allows orchestration without the user needing to fund or interact with a separate smart account.

:::warning[‚ö†Ô∏è Only Available on Some Wallets]
As of now, installing the authorization on the EOA is only available for users of Embedded 
Wallets - such as Privy, Dynamic, Turnkey, ... If your users are using External wallets, 
such as MetaMask, Rabby, etc... - then you need to use the [Fusion Mode](/new/getting-started/enable-mee-eoa-fusion)
:::

::::steps
### 1. Set Up Wallet Client
```ts
import { createWalletClient, http } from "viem";
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";

const eoa = privateKeyToAccount(Bun.env.PRIVATE_KEY as `0x${string}`);

const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  transport: http(),
});
```

### 2. Sign Authorization
```ts
const nexus120Singleton = '0x000000004F43C49e93C970E84001853a70923B03';

const authorization = await walletClient.signAuthorization({
  account: eoa,
  contractAddress: nexus120Singleton,

  // Chain ID 0 makes it valid across all chains
  chainId: 0, 

  // Use nonce 0 for fresh embedded wallet accounts
  nonce: 0    
});
```

:::warning[‚ö†Ô∏è Note for Embedded Wallets]
Privy, Dynamic, and other embedded wallets may expose their own `signAuthorization()` helper with the same parameters. 
In that case you can't use the `viem` `signAuthorization` method as it'll throw an error.

Our docs have integration guides for every type of embedded wallet. You can follow them.

### 3. Initialize Nexus Account
```ts
import { toMultichainNexusAccount, getMEEVersion, MEEVersion } from "@biconomy/abstractjs";
import { base, optimism } from "viem/chains";
import { http } from "viem";

const orchestrator = await toMultichainNexusAccount({
  chainConfigurations: [
    {
      chain: optimism,
      transport: http(),
      version: getMEEVersion(MEEVersion.V2_1_0)
    },
    {
      chain: base,
      transport: http(),
      version: getMEEVersion(MEEVersion.V2_1_0)
    }
  ],
  signer: eoa,

  // Must be overridden when using EIP-7702
  accountAddress: eoa.address 
});
```

### 4. Connect to MEE Relayer
```ts
import { createMeeClient } from "@biconomy/abstractjs";

const meeClient = await createMeeClient({
  account: orchestrator
});
```

### 5. Quote Orchestration
```ts
import { zeroAddress } from "viem";
import { usdcAddresses } from "../utils/addresses/usdc.addresses";

const quote = await meeClient.getQuote({
  instructions: [{
    calls: [{
      to: zeroAddress,
      value: 0n
    }],
    chainId: optimism.id
  }],

  // Must be set for EIP-7702-based orchestration
  delegate: true,          
  
  // Can be passed manually or signed by the SDK
  authorization,          

  feeToken: {
    address: usdcAddresses[base.id],
    chainId: base.id
  },
});

console.log(quote.paymentInfo.tokenAmount);
```
:::info[Passing Authorizations]
We recommend passing authorizations manually as it gives you more control over signing for different chains
and wallet providers. <br/> <br/> However, if you'd just like our SDK to automatically prompt users to sign authorizations,
you can ommit the `authorizations` field and just set `delegate: true`
:::

### 6. Execute Orchestration
```ts
const { hash } = await meeClient.executeQuote({ quote });

const receipt = await meeClient.waitForSupertransactionReceipt({ hash });
```
::::

### Notes
- `delegate: true` is **mandatory**.
- `authorization` must be passed. You can pass it manually (recommended) or allow the SDK to prompt the user to sign.
- `accountAddress` must be **explicitly overridden** to the EOA address to signal EIP-7702 usage.
- The Nexus smart account logic will be executed directly on the EOA address.
